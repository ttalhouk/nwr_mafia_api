There are two gangs who dominate the town:  The Fanboys and The Pietriots.  They've been at war with each other and often the townsfolk are the collateral damage.  The town has had enough and has decided to fight back with swift, but often cruel, justice.  Mistakes will be made, but the town has hired an expert:  Detective Dick.  \n\nUnfortunately, there's a serial killer also on the loose.  The town will have to be judicious in whom they choose to execute daily.  Keep your friends close and your enemies closer; play to win, but win to play; another lame cliche.  \n\nHere are the roles and rules associated with them:\n\nThe Fanboys -  This gang of three will have all odd days (starting with Day 1, go figure.)  They are comprised of one Godfather (who will be the sole person responsible for messaging the narrator--yours truly--about who he wants dead) and two henchmen.\n\nThe Pietriots-- This gang of three with have all even days (day 2!  see how that works?)  They too will have one Godfather and two henchmen.\n\nDectective Dick--Every night he can investigate one person.  The Godfathers will be found as townies.  He may choose to share the info with whomever he trusts, but he cannot kill anyone.\n\nThe Serial Killer--This man is something awful.  Every other night (even nights) he heartlessly kills a random townie.\n\nDoctor Zorders--He has the ability to protect one townie each night.  Unfortunately, he cannot protect himself.      If the mafia should put a hit on whomever he has protected, they still get to take a hit on someone else.  He's most helpful when he doesn't protect mafia.\n\nTown Whore-- This sassy lady has the ability to change any townie's vote.  This role is useful in tight elections.  The town whore cannot make a tie, but she can BREAK a tie.  \n\nTownies -- Innocent, kind, God-fearing individuals who are out for revenge against the bastards who are killing them.  \n\nTHE VIGILANTE:  The vigilante is on the side of the townies and is after the Mafia guys.  He can kill one person a night.

But I will recap the general rules:\n\nRule 1)  You vote for someone\n\nRule 2)  Everyone may vote, regarldess of whether or not you have a special role\n\nRule 3)  You may change your vote at any time.  \n\nRule 4)  You may form alliances and be sneaky while you live, BUT IF YOU DIE, SHUT UP!\n\n\nNow, for the game specific rules:\n\nTwo Mafias in this game again.  Each one has four members.  But both have one shared member.  That man is THE RAT.\n\nThe Reggie Mafia --  4 members -  1 is the Godfather:  Reggie; 1 is THE RAT;  and three henchmen;  they get to vote someone out on every odd day.\n\nThe Kaplan Mafia --  4 members -  1 is the Godmother:  Kaplan; 1 is THE RAT; and three henchmen;  they get to vote someone out on every even day.\n\nAgent  7  --   The Detective.  He gets to inspect one person every night.  Only thing is, if he inspects either of the Godpeoples, they come off as innocent.  On the third night, he gets a freebie from THE RAT.\n\nThe Vigilante --  He can kill one person each night.  But, if he kills anyone who isn't mafia, he dies a horrible death.\n\nCaptain Lavender -- This man has the ability to raise the dead one time regardless of whether or not he's killed.  He cannot raise himself from the dead.  But at any point in the game, he may resurrect one player.  He can also reassign the player to another role.  While he may not add additional roles (i.e. an extra cop, vigilante, or Rat) he may replace them (i.e. a dead cop, a dead vigilante, a dead Godfather).  So, watch out, with Captain Lavender's special powers, that guy who you thought was your faithful mafia friend may now be a townie;  or that cop might now be a mafioso.\n\nAnd the star of the show\n\nTHE RAT:  He belongs to both mafias, but holds no allegiance.  On every third day, he will reveal one mafia member to the game master,  the game master will then reveal that mafia member to Agent 7.  On that third day, Agent 7 will not be allowed to investigate anyone as he is given a freebie.  If THE RAT should survive the annihalation of both Mafias, he then works on his own and will proceed to attempt the wholesale slaughter of the entire town.\n\nAnd of course:\n\nThe Townies -- the regular everyday people who just want to survive and vote out the evil mafia members who are trying to kill them off.\n\nThe setting will be:\n\nThe City of Dugufubuwat "], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.037377"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.037377"]]

He was careful to avoid any mention of Dafagabawat, due to the utter nihilism of the event.\n\nSoon, the drastic measure was on everyone’s lips.  Ninja and Pirate killings were constantly on the minds of everyday townies.  The idea was soon adopted by Rio’s mayor, but with a caveat.\n\n“We certainly cannot proceed in this fashion without some kind of safeguarding!  The idea of killing citizens off daily without some sort of trial is unfathomable.  So, as a compromise, I have randomly chosen a defense attorney and judge.  Should either of them die, they will then choose their successor; should the successor die, he will again choose who shall follow his footsteps.  We can only pray that these jobs do not fall in the wrong hands!”\n\nThe Rules:\n\nEveryday each townsperson is allowed to vote for whomever he believes is either a Pirate or a Ninja.  Since all roles remain anonymous, Pirates and Ninjas will vote along with the townies.\n\nIf a player does not vote within a two day time-frame, that person shall be considered deceased.  However, if a player contacts the game-master to say that he will be gone for more than two days for whatever reason, then the player will be granted leave without penalty.\n\nPirates and Ninjas will have kills on alternating days (Pirates odd days Ninjas even days—these are not based on calendar numbers, but rather on game days, i.e. day 1 is odd, day 2 is even).  The only ones who may contact the game-master with the kill will be the head of either group.  The heads of the Pirates and Ninjas are Sweet Pete and Storm Snake respectively.  Each faction will have four members, the head and three henchmen.\n\nNow, without further ado, I present to you the:\n\nDramatis Personae\n\nPirates – Odd Days\n\nHeaded by the fearsome Sweet Pete, Pirate of the Jungle, this scruffy band makes the town’s lives a living hell by looting and pillaging.  Somehow, though, they rarely get caught and the town simply can’t distinguish between them, the Ninjas, nor themselves.  This very well may have something to do with the town’s cultural diversity.\n\n\nNinjas – Even Days\n\nSome consider these men to be the greater foes of the town.  Despite their leader’s name, Storm Snake, being widely known, all else about them remains a mystery.  They hold no love for either Pirate or Townsfolk and kill indiscriminately.  They’re shady, stealthy, and totally sweet.  \n\nSenhor Policia – The head of the Detective Unit of Rio de Setembro (DUR), he runs a nightly investigation on each town member.  Due to the relatively unsophisticated computer system of the town, he can only get information on one townsperson each night.  Unfortunately, due to the strict laws preventing any actual police work, he cannot act upon any of his investigations by killing anyone.  Also, the Mafia leaders (godfathers) are invisible to Senhor Policia as they are experts at hiding in plain sight.\n\nPiranha – This saucy maiden is quite beguiling.  She’s exceedingly wealthy, yet has never held an actual job.  How she makes her money is quite a mystery, but it may have something to do with her connections with the town’s elite and her nightly parties.\n\nIwamatsu the Ronin – This samurai immigrated to Rio to escape his violent past.  But the Ninjas have brought dishonor to his culture.  He has decided to take up arms each night and do battle against them.  But, he has sworn to himself, should he kill an innocent, he will perform seppuku. \n\nBlue Bangs – A former pirate, his gang was destroyed by Sweet Pete’s rotten bunch.  He holed up with a former Ninja master and has learned the ways of Ninjutsu, making him the first ever Ninja Pirate.  His guiding light is burning hatred.  Every night he may kill off any person he chooses.\n\nTHE COURT SYSTEM\n\nThe Townies act as the Prosecutor by voting up one man whose fate will be decided by:\n\nPhoenix Wright – Defense Attorney\n\nThis man was specially picked by the mayor.  Each night he has to decide whether or not to defend the man chosen to be prosecuted.  If he refuses, the chosen dies, if he accepts then the final decision goes to:\n\nJudge Wapner\n\nWhen Phoenix decides to defend a townie, he makes the Guilty or Not Guilty call.\n\nAnyone who is on the docket cannot be killed that night as he is under protection of the jail guards.\n\nIMPORTANT – THESE ROLES WILL BE PASSED ON SHOULD THEY DIE.   THE PERSON WHO HOLDS THESE ROLES WILL CHOOSE HIS SUCCESSOR.  WHEN THERE ARE FIVE OR FEWER TOWNIES, THESE POSITIONS WILL BE LIQUIDATED.\n\nAnd of course The Good People of Rio de Setembro."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.039824"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.039824"]]

Two factions have formed and each has everything to lose and everything to gain by either losing or winning the war.  \n\nBoth sides have come upon new technologies that could finally devestate the other and have hired operatives specialized in infiltration.\n\nThese nations are:\n\nThe Confederation of Wii\n\nand \n\nSonyfornia\n\n\nThe poor citizens have suffered long enough and wish to return to the peace and prosperity they once shared.  But millions had already chosen sides long before the first shot was fired.  Righteous, misguided anger seems to poison the very air that everyone breaths.  But a  few citizens have had enough and have decided to take the war to The Confederation and Sonyfornia and stop them both.\n\nThe roles include:\n\nThe Confederation Spys:  Two men headed by a leader, Moto.  They plan on releasing a virus that will destroy the very foundation of Sonyfornia's massive army.  Moto is completely invisible to the Citizen's Emissary.  They have one kill on odd days.  Moto must assign a henchman to each killing.\n\nSonyfornia Spec Ops:  Two men headed by a leader, Kurt.  They plan on intercepting the Spys and send recon info back to base so the Sonyfornian Chief General can crush the Confederation with their massive weaponry.  Kurt is invisible to the Citizen's Emissary.  They have one kill on even days.  Kurt must assign a henchman to each killing.\n\nBill -  He is a wealthy citizen who plans on destroying both sides on his own terms.  But in order to do so he needs to form a powerful team.  Each night he looks to recruit the right man for the job.  His hope is to find...\n\nPeter - A charismatic man who knows how to pull a team together.  If Bill finds him, he will automaticaly recruit...\n\nJ - A computer hacker of devestating ability.  He has sided with the citizens, but has become more militant in his desire to destroy both companies.  Joining up with Bill and Peter is right up his alley.\n\nTogether, the three form the X-Team.  If they form, they will have one kill each night.  Citizen fighters are simply collatoral damage.  They are all invisible to the Citizen's Emissary unless they have formed together.  At which point none of them have the immunity of Kurt or Moto.  Bill will assign the henchman for each killing.\n\nCitzen's Emissary -  Working for the citizens, the emissary is a man of incredible stealth and intelligence, he has the ability to either investigate or kill each night.  He works side by side with. . .\n\nThe Emissary's Deputy - He has the ability to protect someone each night.  Anyone he protects is not only untouchable by the three groups, but also immune to being voted out the next day by the Citizens.  The deputy, however, cannot protect the Emissary.\n\nThe Defenders of the Keep - These three are a group of citizens who set up ingenious obstacles.  They can prevent one person from being killed each night.  Not only that, but if they successfully block a target, the group cannot make another strike that night.  So, if the Confederation should make a hit on Mr. X, and he is protected by the Defenders, then that night they go without a kill.\n\nThe Downtrodden Man - This is a man who has lost all hope for the future.  He plans on the night of the third day to strike out and kill two people with him.  If he succeeds in killing at least one member of the three fighting factions, he will live to strike one more time on day five.  If this man is voted out, he will take out the last person who votes for him.  If any of the assigned henchmen kill the DM, he dies. If the Emissary kills the DM, the DM gets to pick one other person to die with him. If the last person to vote for the DM is protected by the Emissary's assistant, then he will not die.  If a Mafia member is protected and kills the DM, then he will not die.  These are the only ways to kill the DM without casualties.\n\nThe Citizens - Unkown to eachother, they hope to rid themselves of both factions and start a new government of peace.\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.045498"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.045498"]]

Why did she get up early again?  Oh yeah!  She knew it was supposed to rain today, the best time to hook an elusive Coelacanth.  After cramming her fishing pole into her dress, she made her way outside.  As the news had forecasted, a steady rain was falling.  Pulling out her stylish umbrella, she skipped merrily down to the beach.  Once there, she started walking as to avoid scaring away her unsuspecting prey.  A shadow!  She cast her line in the direction the shadow was looking.  The fish then turned and swam the other direction!  \"Augh!,\" she murmured, as she cast her line again....and again...and again...Finally she hooked the fish!  \"A SEABASS?  WHAT THE ****!?\"  As she chucked the fish back into the sea she caught a face-full of tail.  But Tangy wasn't about to give up.  She caught another sea bass, and another...and another...\"Where are all the good fish!?,\" she cried out in disgust.  Then a unusually large shadow caught her eye.

Rather, we've pulled in some dark individuals that thrive on ambition and deceit...And I don't just mean the usual \"tree choppers.\"  It's not a secret that the local monopolizing raccoon, Tom Nook, and his trusty \"Crooked Cranny 'Coons\" are at war with Black Market veteran Crazy Redd; bodies are found all the time!

Being the perfectionist he is, he only investigates the identity of one town member each night.\n\nMint - This spunky squirrel gets around town faster than anyone, and if you've played Animal Crossing, you know just how fast it is to get around town...With her powers of \"persuasion,\" she is able to sway a close vote in the direction she desires every night...\n\nBlanca - A mysterious foreigner made her way into town before the gates were closed.  She can steal the face of a single person at any point in the game (overnight), killing the original owner of the role in the process...If Blanca ends up wishing to kill someone who is being targetted by Death or Mafia, Blanca will reach the victim first...If Blanca kills Cube, she will die...\n\nK.K. Slider - The local guitar-strumming legend is also an ally of justice...Upset at the general lack of motivation of the Villagers in tracking down the scum of Beanerville, he's become a vigilante...He has enough time to plan one attack on a single person every night, but if kills an innocent his life is forfeit...\n\nDeath AKA Mr. Resetti - Who we believe to be a very strict anti-reset mole is actually a messenger from above...He can leave his hole every night to kill one person of his choice...However, if he kills Sable, he will forfeit his position in this world as well...EDIT: I forgot to note that Detective Copper sees Death as a Villager as well...\n\nGuardian Angel AKA Sable - The calm seamstress is the second messenger sent from the other side...She knows the intentions of Death every night, and can protect a single person from Death's touch over the course of the game...otherwise, she can protect one person a night...I guess it's also important to note that Detective Copper is not a medium (one who can see ghosts), and thus Sable's identity to him is \"Villager\"...\n\nCube the Suicide Penguin - This crazy penguin is the most dangerous character of the game, and there is no reasoning for his threats...\n- can choose 2 people to kill on one night, but he also dies\n- if he is killed over-night, the person that killed him also dies\n- if he is voted off, all of those who voted for him will die\n\nBomber's Apprentice - Unfortunately, Cube has taken in an apprentice...When or if Cube dies, his protege will take over the role of Suicide Bomber...It is also important to note that the Apprentice could be ANYONE in the game, even if they already have a role...If the Apprentice has another role, their other role will be their identity if they are investigated...\n\nVillagers - Innocent townies who just want to live the rest of their lives fishing, gardening, and insect catching in peace..."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.048259"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.048259"]]

Pokemon lived with other Pokemon in a glorious state of Nirvana.  Of course this bliss could not last forever.  One day a random human came marching through.  After beating on a defenseless Pidgey for a while, they stuffed it in a tiny ball and took it home.  “Wow!” thought his friends, “How fun is that?!”  A nearby Rattata heard this and sensed the impending doom.  It ran out to the woods to warn the other Pokemon.\n\nThey couldn't stop the onslaught of greedy kids.  The term “Gotta catch 'em all” haunted their dreams.  A Pokemon's purpose was now to fight with other Pokemon.  The humans had opened Pandora's Box.  Something snapped inside many of the creatures.  Some craved power.  Others craved intelligence.  Some craved the happiness they once had.\n\nTwo opposing groups intended to use fear to achieve their goals.  Pokemon were either with them or against them.  If they were against them, they were as good as dead in their minds.\n\nThe leader of one group pictured himself snapping the necks of anyone who got in his way.  He called his crew “Snap.”\n\nThe other group couldn't think of a good name.  The leader thought, “Wouldn't it be cool if we just stuck two random letters together?”  From that point on, they were known as “XD”.\n\nA third group of Pokemon were sick of what their nice little community had become.  They felt that all Pokemon, including themselves, should be dead.  Their power was too great.  The problem is, this particular group of Pokemon weren't really good at anything.  Even suicide missions were often a bit too tough and ended up in failure.  Oh sure, their target would die, but they, themselves would often walk away unscathed.  Looking at how much they sucked at what they did, the only name that came to their head was “Dash.”\n\nThe rest of the Pokemon just wanted all this internal violence to end.  They put forth a system of voting that would eliminate a bad monster every night.  The problem is, the bad monsters got to vote too and none of the Pokemon were willing to trust each other, so they didn't even know who their comrades were.\n\n\nHard rules.\nSnap – Every third night is an action night starting with the first night.\nXD – Every third night is an action night starting with the second night.\nDash – Every third night is an action night starting with the third night.\n\nIf any of these teams are eliminated their action nights remain the same.  Therefore it is in the townies best interests to get rid of an entire team as fast as possible.\n\nThere are many special roles in this game.  They are being intentionally withheld to hopefully make things more interesting.\n\nNothing in this game is a sure thing.  Every possible action has probabilities associated with it.  You will have to trust me to treat these probabilities with respect and I will never reveal the hard numbers.\n\nSome minor exceptions to this rule.\nDash will (almost) always have a successful kill if they order it.  The probability comes in when seeing whether or not they are fully 'successful' and die along with their target.  They are really bad at what they do.\n\nIf a member of Dash is killed in any way, the player who kills them will (almost) ALWAYS die.  After a vote, one player will be selected at random to carry out the kill FROM ALL OF THE PLAYERS!  Even if you don't vote for the person who ends up with the most votes, you may still be chosen to carry out the kill.\n\nVictory Conditions:\nMember of Snap:  At the end of the game only Snap members remain.  Even if you died during the game, you will still be declared a winner if this holds true.\n\nMember of XD:  Same as Snap only with XD members.\n\nMember of Dash:  Everyone must die.  If only Dash members remain you will hold a glorious suicide ritual and each member of Dash, even the dead, will be declared winners.\n\nTownies:  You must survive the entire game to the point where no Snap, XD, or Dash members are left.  If you die, you can not be declared a winner.\n\nYou cannot willfully jump sides like I attempted in Mafia V.

Marge was at the grocery store with Maggie, when suddenly, the ground began to shake.  She ran outside to see what was the matter, as the ground began to heave more and more violently.  Suddenly, the Power Plant that had so long been on the horizon exploded in a great mushroom cloud, and much of the town was destroyed by either the quakes, or the explosion.  Letting out a bloodcurdling scream of horror, Marge ran home to check on Bart and Lisa, and to try to find out the fate of her dear Homer.\n\n   There were two groups of survivors from the explosion of the power plant:\n\n---Mr. Burns was among the survivors, when the explosion occurred he was sitting in his mansion, discussing with his Blood Sucking lawyers how to legally sell the organs of workers who died in accidents.  In an Ironic twist, the plant exploded just before they managed work that into the contracts of all of the employees.  Burns was furious not only because he lost the plant, but also, all the employees died before he could harvest their organs.  Burns believed the accident was due to the incompetence of the workers, namely the plant’s safety inspector, Homer Simpson.  Burns and his lawyers will exact their revenge on even numbered nights.\n\n---Oddly enough Homer and some of his buddies were also among the survivors, they were out getting hot dogs when the explosion occurred.  Homer’s scream of D’OH was so loud that they heard it in Shelbyville.  Upset that all of their friends in the plant had died, Homer blamed Mr. Burns for buying cheap, poorly built parts.  Homer and his crew will exact their revenge on Mr. Burns on odd numbered days.\n\n               -Godfathers come up as innocents, if they are inspected\n   -Unless they are the only person left, godfathers must send a henchman to make their kill.  So they need  to pm me the victim and who is going to make the hit.\n\n   While much of the town was destroyed, there are still plenty of people around to sort this whole mess out.\n\n---Mayor Quimby: Me, In light of this tragic event, I have decided to gather the whole town in the town hall, so that we can take care of the mafia.\n\n---My Mistress:  She has some influence over me (because of her huge magumbos).  If there is a tie, she decides who is killed.  If my mistress is killed, I will just have to go to my room, flip a coin, and weep for all of the registered voters who have died.\n\n---Wayland Smithers was chewing food for Mr. Burns at the time of the explosion, his attachment to Mr. Burns is so strong that, should Mr. Burns be killed, Smithers will go on a murderous rampage, and take the lives of 2 Springfielders the next day.\n\n---Marge Simpson: Hell hath no fury like a woman’s scorn.  Should Homer die, in her anguish, Marge will kill 2 people the next day.\n\n---Bart and Lisa Simpson have decided to help the people, and will protect one person each night.  If both are alive, they must agree on who to protect  (So they must BOTH PM me).  Whomever they protect is also immune from the vote the next day.  I will not tell who they are protecting, so if the person whom they are protecting is voted out, then nothing happens.  Also, if their protectee is attacked, the attacker dies along with one of the two simpsons (I flip a coin to decide which one)\n\n---Maggie Simpson:  Suck Suck…….Suck Suck……Suck Suck…….Oh, and she kills one person a night.\n\n---Krusty: has the ability to distract Maggie, Bart, and Lisa, and prevent their actions.  However, he can only distract each child once.  So he can stop Maggie once, and he can stop Bart and Lisa twice (once for Bart, and once for Lisa).\n\n---Moe Syzlak:  Owner of the bar, Moe has connections from the people who get drunk in his bar.  Every night he has the ability to get any one person to tell them what their target is.\n\n---Barney Gumble: armed with his explosive belching, and bombs made out of Duff bottles, Barney has decided to end his own life, and he wants to take as many people out with him as possible:\n   -kill two people on one night (as well as himself)\n   -If he is voted out, all who vote for him die\n   -If he is attacked, the attacker who makes the hit dies with him.\n\n---Patty and Selma:  Because no one can actually see them, due to the incredible amount of tobacco smoke, they can kill once during the game, and take their victim’s place.  Like Bart and Lisa they must agree on their actions and both PM me.  Example, they must both agree on who to replace, and should they take the place of a godfather, they must both agree on their assassinations.  Also, since they are always together, should one die, the other one dies as well.\n\n---Police Chief Wiggum has decided to figure this whole thing out, so he gets to investigate one person a night, however, since he has such stubby legs, he can’t catch anyone, and is unable to make any kills.\n\n---Ned Flanders:  Has taken it upon himself to end the sin in the town, with a cross on his chest, and the power of God on his side, he seeks to send the evildoers to hell didely ell with one kill every night.  Should he kill an innocent, he will take his own life.\n   *special notes about flanders*\n   -Marge and Smithers are guilty because it is in the townies best interest to kill them before a godfather.\n   -Patty and Selma are innocent until they make their kill, then it depends on whose role they take.\n   -Bart and Lisa, Krusty, and Moe are innocent.\n   -Maggie is guilty, even though it is a shame to kill a baby.  I know it does not sound right for flanders to kill her, but I willl explain should the situation come up\n   \n---Townies:  They all just want to sort out this whole mess so that they can put this tragedy behind them, and get on with their lives.\n\nVOTE QUIMBY…..WAIT, don’t vote quimby!\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.055291"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.055291"]]

Mad Gear controls major criminal activity in the city. When they learned of Haggar's plans, they took immediate action to bring this new mayor under their control.\n\nIn 1989.\n\n\n\nHaggar:  Hello?  Mike Haggar here.\nPhone:  Hee hee hee, Mr. Haggar.  So pleased to make your acquaintance.  I believe you know who I am!  Don't hang up!  We have a little business proposition for you...  Your INTERNET FORUM for your cooperation.  And we'll throw in the regular monthly bonus \nto your salary we offered before.\nHaggar:  What?!  What happened to MIKE'S FUNHOUSE?? Who is this?!\nPhone:  Not so fast, Mike.  Turn on your TV.\n(Haggar turns on the TV.  On the screen is the Mad Gear gang trolling his personal forum!)\nHaggar:  You fiend! \nPhone:  Nothing yet...but we will if you don't cooperate.  Listen to reason.  Why make your job difficult? Just let us do as we please like the mayor before you did!\n\n\nMEANWHILE:\nCody:  What?!  Mike's Forum?! TROLLED!?\nGuy:  What's a forum?\nCody:  It's on the internet.  The Mad Gears must pay!\nGuy:  What a dirty trick!  I will help you out.\nCody: You go ahead while I try to lose this crazy transexual.\n\n\n\nLATER:\nDean: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor! The city is under attack by the SKULL CROSS GANG!\nHaggar: What?!\nDean: Wait a minute Mr. Mayor. I can lead you to them. \nHaggar: Who the heck are you?! \nDean: Does it really matter?! All you need to know is that I know where they're headed.\nMike Haggar: I haven't got a choice so I'll trust you.  But if you're leading me into a trap, I'm gonna grind you into the pavement. Let's hit the streets!! \n\nIf this is your first time playing mafia, this is a game detective work, suspicion, and double-crossing. Good guys try to vote out the gangs, and the gangs try to take out all of the other players. It's fun and easy!\n\nROLE INTRODUCTIONS:\nThe Heroes\n Mayor Mike Haggar will clean up the streets by wailing on people with a giant pipe, pretty much. He's addicted to the internet, though, so he'll only go out and wail on someone when he feels like - the classic vigilante role. His term as mayor will be over if he takes out anybody but a gangster, though! Even the serial killer, this time!\n\n Guy can use his ninja clan connections and stealth to investigate all but the top gang leaders every night. The classic cop role.\n\n Cody loves to punch guys and get into trouble. If he's voted out, he can escape from jail; he's a good guy, but he's a jailbreaker. The catch is, if that happens, everyone will obviously know his identity. Many other roles revolve around Cody in some way, too.\n\nPublic Nuisances - Some are good guys, some are just jerks\n Two-P has a choice of joining Mad Gear, giving them an extra member, or joining Cody as a townie (they will then know each other and be able to work together in votes or whatever). If investigated, only the role will be discovered, but not which side they have joined.\n\n Dean gets the same deal, except with the Skull Cross gang. If both Two-P and Dean side with Cody, that's quite a group to start with, but maybe being in a mafia is safer. Or is it?\n\n Poison, the ultra hot gangster slut, has a big surprise! She can, scratch that, will seduce a vote out of anyone she wants, daily, but only to Cody, because she wants him all to herself for some hot conjugal visits. If she doesn't report in with which vote she wants to change, a vote from the highest non-tie creating bloc will be changed to Cody. She can still help the townies a bit through clever vote manipulation and is on the townie's side, basically. If Cody is taken out of the game, she'll revert to the classic town whore role.\n\n Roxy, Poison's close friend and palette swap, is a normal town whore role.\n\n Rolento is a jerk that blows guys up with grenades. As the classic suicide bomber, he can blow up two people and himself whenever he feels like it. Or everybody that votes for him if he's voted out. Or the bottom-ranked member of the gang that takes him out. Watch out for El Gado, though.\n\n El Gado lives for revenge against Rolento. He will serial kill people every other night without consequence until Rolento is dead. When Rolento dies, he becomes a townie and loses his ability to kill people. He can win with the townies... or by himself. He's the only guy that can kill Rolento without being blown up.\n\n The Barrel contains a delicious roast that will restore a player to a vacant role at the whim of the Barrel, even if the barrel has already been taken out. It's a magic barrel that is also registered to vote.\n\n Sodom, the ultimate wanna-be, can bump off anyone and assume their role.\n\nAnd, of course, an indeterminate number of townies.\n\nThe Gangsters\nMad Gear:\n Belger is the leader of Mad Gear and will be shown as a townie to investigators.\n Edi.E is the #2 Mad Gear goon in this game, and can investigate a player every night.\n MG Goon is the 3rd rank Mad Gear gangster, or 4th if Two-P joins.\n\nSkull Cross:\n Black is the leader of Skull Cross and will be shown as a townie to alligators.

In the game of Mafia, there are basically two sides. Innocents known as townies and Bad guys known as Mafia. The game is played over a course of days. Each day, everybody can vote for one person to be eliminated from the game. The person with the highest amount of votes is the one eliminated. The townies are trying to vote out the mafia while the mafia is trying to vote out the townies. This is not as easy as it sounds. The mafia have an advantage by knowing who all their members are, while the townies don't know who else is innocent besides themselves. The mafia also has another advantage by the fact that they can make a hit every night. The next day, the person who was voted out is killed in a little story and their role revealed. The person who the mafia hit is also killed and their role mentioned in the story as well.\n\nVote Rules\n\nTo vote, simply type in bold: VOTE (NAME) You may post anything else you want during the day or with that message. You can only vote for one person. If you wish to change your vote, make sure to erase the old vote. Only votes that are in bold will be counted. If you have two votes, neither will count. \n\nYou must vote at least once every two days. Failure to vote will result in death. If you have a reason for not voting in time, PM me before the third day of abscence to let me know. \n\nTies\n\nIf there is a tie at the deadline, there is a simple procedure for solving it. Anyone who has not voted that day has 10 minutes after the dead line to vote for one of the people tied up. If after 10 minutes, there is still a tie, anyone who didn't vote that day will be killed instead. So if there were 4 people who didn't vote, I'd randomly select one to die instead. Maybe 2 if I'm cranky. But what if everyone voted and there was still a tie. Then, there will be the 10 minute delay to change one's vote for someone else. If after the 10 minutes, there is still a tie, then those who are tied will be exempt and I will randomly select someone else to die. Should have saved yourself.\n\nTo Win\n\nFor the townies to win, every mafia member must be killed and only innocent townies remain.\n\nFor the mafia to win, they only have to get to the point where it is equal townies and mafia. Example, 3 townies left and 3 mafia members left. At that point, it is assumed the mafia take over.\n\nNote: there are also different roles with a different win condition. Example, Suicide Bomber's win is to kill everyone. Also, if there are 3 mafia but 2 townies and the suicide bomber, the game does not end as the bomber could wipe out the mafia's advantage. The reverse is true also. If all mafia are voted out but the bomber is still alive, townies have not won yet as the bomber may have a chance to kill them all.\n\nFor all roles that don't belong in one of the two groups of mafia or townie, they are considered a faction of their own and will have a different win condition listed.\n\nThe Roles\n\nMafia\n\nIn this game of mafia, we are starting out with only one mafia. However, if I feel a substantial amount of people have joined, I will add a second mafia. The second mafia will have the same roles as this one.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nThis is the head of the mafia. He is the one who ultimately decides who gets whacked each night. On the mafia's action night, he will send me the name of the person he chooses to have killed.\n\nThe Mafia Spy\n\nAnother mafia member. He has the ability to investigate any person to see what their role is. On the mafia's action night, he sends me the name of the person he wants investigated and I send him their role.\n\nThe Mafia Recruiter\n\nA third mafia member. He has the ability to recruit people to join the mafia. However, his ability is limited. On the mafia's action night, he will send me the name of the person he wishes to have join the mafia. He will also choose a number between 1 and 6. Then, I will roll a dice. If the number matches, it's a succesful recruitment. If not, the recruitment fails. Also, the person who is being recruited does not know any of this unless the recruitment is succesful. They will then be sent a PM, letting them know they are now mafia.\n\nThe Mafia Doctor\n\nOur fourth mafia member. The doctor has the ability to protect any one he chooses, except himself. There is one catch, however. The doctor can not use his ability until the townie doctor is killed. As long as the townie doctor is alive, the mafia doctor can not forge his credentials and start practicing medicine. Once he has his ability, each night, he will send me the name of the person he is protecting.\n\nThe Mafia Propagandist\n\nA new role for the mafia. The propagandist has two abilites. Before the game begins, he will give me the name of one person he wants corrupted. This person can be anyone from the bomber to the cop to a rival mafia member if we add another mafia. This corrupted person effectively becomes another mafia member, swayed by propaganda. The propagandist can also tell the corrupted townie how to vote. The other ability the propagandist has is being able to cancel one person's vote each night. The propagandist will send me a PM of the person who's vote he wants cancelled.\n\nThe Corrupted Townie\n\nOur final mafia member. The corrupted townie could be anyone. What's worse is that no one can know he's corrupted. If he is investigted, he will only register as a normal townie or any other role he might have. The corrupted townie only listens to the Propagandist, however and votes according to his wishes. If the propagandist is killed, the corrupted townie has a choice. Stay with the mafia or join the townies again. If he joins the townies, this action will be revealed in the story the next day. He is free to reveal anything he may know. If he stays with the mafia, he will then learn who all the mafia consists of if he doesn't know yet and he is free to vote how he wants, no longer controlled by the propagandist.\n\nFinal notes for Mafia Members\n\nNew Godfathers\n\nThe mafia has the ability to choose a new godfather any day. \n\nTo do so, all members must PM me saying they want a new godfather. They must also give me the name of the person they want to see as the new godfather. The corrupted townie can not vote, however anyone succesfully recruited can. Also the corrupted townie does not need to send a PM asking for a new godfather. \n\nThe new godfather will be the person with the most votes and the old godfather will be killed. If there is a tie, 2-2, then no one becomes godfather but the old godfather will still be killed. This means the mafia must solve their differences and elect a new godfather fast, otherwise they will make no kills. \n\nAlso, when making a succesful coup, I will only PM the new godfather, informing him of his extra role. I will not give the voting record nor will I PM the other mafia members letting them know who is the new godfather. That is the new godfather's responsibility. This means in a tie, I will not PM anyone. You will have to figure that out yourselves and revote.\n\nThe Mole.\n\nWhy would you vote your godfather? He might be the mole. \n\nThe mole is another new role. At the end of Day 2, I will randomly select one mafia member to become the mole except for the corrupted townie. The mole is a member of the mafia, working against the mafia. How does it work? \n\nThe mole will PM with a message. This message will contain the name of a mafia member and their role. It's the mole's choice who. The mole will also give me the name of the person he would like to send this information too. Then, I will PM that person with a package. The package will be the info the mole gave me. The mafia member's name and role. The person who recieves the package will only know it was given to him be the mole's role, i.e. Godfather, Spy, Doctor, etc. \n\nThis is significant because if that person ends up being recruited, he will know who the mole is. The mole must also be careful not to hit the townie idiot. The townie idiot will post the entire contents of the package including the mole's role. \n\n\nThe Townies\n\nThe Doctor\n\nThe doctor can protect anyone he wants, except himself. Before the day begins, he can PM me with a name if he wants or he can wait until the evening and PM me. Why wait? Well, if the doctor wants, he can save the person with the most votes. Then the person with the next amount of votes will be killed instead. If the doctor is corrupted, he will do the bidding of the propagandist and use his role as the propagandist wants. If he is recruited, he is free to protect who he wants. Of course, he will be working for the mafia in these cases. Also, if he is recruited or corrupted, the mafia doctor may begin practicing medicine. Neither doctor can protect the other.\n\nThe Cop\n\nThe cop is working for the townies and may investigate one person each night. He can see all roles except for the corrupted townie or the mole. And, like usual, the Godfather will show up as a townie. If the cop is corrupted, he'll do as the propagandist wants. If he's recruited, he uses his power for the mafia.\n\nThe Townie Idiot\n\nThe townie idiot is a drunk who can't keep anything to himself. Any information he is given will be revealed, except for his role, strangely enough. The townie idiot is playing for the townies but he it can be hard tell. What does this mean? If the townie idiot is corrupted, he will tell eveyone he's corrupted and who corrupted him. If he's recruited, he becomes the mafia idiot and starts naming names. Consider him a whammy.\n\nThe Drifter\n\nI don't think I have ever seen this role used once. So, let's give it one more shot. The drifter has the ability to take over anyone's role. He just PM's me the name of the person he wants to become. That person is killed. Their role, whatever it may be, becomes the drifter's. Here's some added value to the role. If he's corrupted, he could take over the godfather role. Then the godfather would be in the hands of the propagandist. However, taking over a mafia role means he would stay mafia if the propagandist was killed. If he's recruited, he can take over anyone's role in the mafia if he wants. However, if uses his role and gets a different role outside of the mafia after being recruited, he still stay mafia.\n\nThe Magician\n\nThe magician is a new role. The magician can change the roles of anyone every night. How does that work? Each night, the magician PM's me the names of two people. I then will PM those people and inform them of their new role. There are some things to keep in mind. The magician never knows if the action was a success. No one else knows who has switched roles except for the librarian. Also, certain roles can not be switched. A mafia member can not switch roles with a townie. However, if two mafia members were selected, they could switch roles because they are in the same mafia. The mole role will never be switched. The corrupt townie could be switched. That spells trouble for the propagandist. The librarian role can not be switched. Yes, the magician can also use his name for switching roles and give his role to someone else.\n\nThe Librarian\n\nKnowlegde is power. The librarian must figure out how to use that power correctly. The librarian will learn a ratio of people's roles. Say 30 people are playing, the librarian can the learn the roles of about 7 others. How does this work? Well, the librarian can ask to learn the roles for whoever he choses up to a limit, in this example, up to 7 people. The librarian can ask for this information before the game begins or any time thereafter. Nor does the librarian have to ask for all 7 choices right away. The librarian could chose to wait and learn about a person anytime they wished. Moreover, anyone the librarian asks about, that person's role will always be revealed. So, if someone is recruited or corrupted, the librarian will know this. If their role is switched the librarian will learn the new role but not who got the switched role unless that person is also on the librarian's list. The librarian can also learn who the mole is if that person is on the librarian's list. Obviously then, the librarian would be desired by the mafia. However, if the librarian is blabbermouth or unable to use this knowledge well, the librarian may soon be taking a dirtnap. Of course, corrupted, the librarian would do the propagandist's bidding. Recruited, the librarian aids the mafia.\n\nThe Bounty Hunter\n\nThe bounty hunter is out to rid the world of the mafia. He'll do it both the honest way (voting with everyone) and his own way (killing them himself). Yes, the bounty hunter fills the vigilante role. Each night, he can PM me the name of a person he wants killed. The catch is the person must be a mafia member. If he kills an innocent, he dies along with the innocent. If the bounty hunter is corrupted, he'll kill whoever the propagandist wants. But, the bounty hunter can not be recruited. He would kill himself and the recruiter before will joining a mafia. Brainwashing is different.\n\nNon-Townie Roles\n\nThe Suicide Bomber\n\nYes, the bomber is back. New and improved. The bombeer may at any time, choose 3 people to blow up and die with him. If he is voted out, everyone who voted for him will be blown up. If a mafia hits him, two mafia members die: The godfather and another mafia member of the godfather's choosing. More than that, every two days that the suicide bomber lives, he plants explosives on someone else. Only I and the bomber know who else would be a walking time bomb. The librarian can know if that person is one on their list. The bomber has no rational except to see everyone die. As for the walking time bomb, if they are voted out, the suicide bomber can choose two people who voted for the time bomb to be killed with the time bomb. If corrupted, the bomber doesn't neccassarily do the propagandist's bidding. Because he is irrational, he still shows independence and does what he wants. If recruited, the bomber still does as he wants. If he wants to blow up a part of this mafia, he can. Moreover, the bomber can not win a mafia victory. He can only win by the death of everyone.\n\nThe Killer\n\nThe killer works alone. He is out for himself and himself only. He can only win by being the last one standing. The killer has a small advantage. Because he is an expert at what he does, he is the only one who can safely kill a time bomb or the bomber and not die. He can a make a hit every night against anyone he chooses. If he is corrupted, he does the propagandist's bidding. If he is recruited, he may win with a mafia victory.\n\n\nThat should be all the roles for now. I'll wait to see how many sign-up before deciding if we need a second mafia or some extra roles. It will sort of be like F-Zero Gx. The more people we get, the more stuff we can unlock. The reason I mention F-Zero GX is because that is the theme of the game!\n\nThe Theme\n\nYes, this mafia game will revolve around F-Zero GX. It was for that reason I gave no names for the roles. You can choose any character you want from F-Zero GX as your persona in the game. Except for Mr. Zero, the announcer. That role will be mine as the narrator. What's that you don't know many F-Zero Characters. Well, Wikipedia has a couple pages of racers for you as well as a brief bio of them. So choose the one that appeals to you and run with it.\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.060972"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.060972"]]

Fox was relaxing on Sauria when he got a distress call from Slippy....\n\nFox quickly shared the news with the rest of the team, and General Peppy.\n\nAnd so Fox, Falco, and Krystal boarded the Great Fox and made their way to the Lonely Hearts Inn, a vacation satellite orbiting Cornaria. Soon after their arrival, the following message was sent:\n\n\"Report to General Peppy from Fox McCloud:\n\nOutside communication has been cut off, but we finally managed to get a message through. We've made it to the Inn, and Slippy and everyone else is okay. But the situation is far worse than we thought - Star Wolf is being lead by Andross, and he's here on the satellite! To make matters worse, he's flooded the corridors with deadly gas. My team, every vacationer, and me are trapped in our individual rooms - the only places that are safe from the gas.\n\nWe're going to try and take care of Andross and Star Wolf - we know they're trapped in their rooms too, so it'll be a piece of cake for ROB to drop bombs on their locations. The only problem is - we've checked the guest list, and they aren't on it. Which means there are four traitors on board who are hiding and protecting the bad guys in their rooms, and we don't know who they are. We suspect that Andross has subjected these traitors, and maybe even Star Wolf, to some form of mind control.\n\nIt isn't all bad, though. Each room is equipped with a powerful Ultra 64 computer, and I can talk with everyone on the satellite over the Ultra 64 network. We've decided that everyone will vote on who the traitors are. Whoever the vacationers decide is a bad guy, will be blown up. It'll be tricky, because the traitors will be able to vote too, and Andross and Star Wolf will be able to monkey around with us as well. But it's our only option. I hope no innocent people are killed.\n\nFox Out.\"\n\nAndross and Star Wolf taunt Fox and company by day, and kill by night.\n\nAndross - BlackNMild. Kills one vacationer ever night. Has the power to make the traitor who is protecting him appear like an innocent vacationer to the investigator. \nWolf O' Donnel - Blackfootsteps.\nLeon Powalski - Mario.\nPanther Caroso - Mystic Gohan. \n\nThe traitors – Loyal to Andross, each one is hiding either Andross or a member of Star Wolf. If a traitor is voted out, both the traitor and the bad guy he is protecting dies.\n\nIf Andross dies, he gets to choose which member of Star Wolf will become the new leader. This person will be capable of killing, but not of making his protector appear innocent. His hold on his followers will not be as strong as Andross’s – if his fellow Star Wolf members, or the traitors, disagree with who he is planning on killing on any given night, they can choose to overrule him. If there are at least two traitors remaining, and every traitor sends in the name of an alternate target, that person will be killed instead. Similarly, if there are at least three members of Star Wolf remaining, the leader’s fellow Star Wolf members can also pick an alternate target (Star Wolf alternate targets trump traitor alternate targets.)\n\nFox McCloud - while better known as a fighter pilot, Fox is also a skilled investigator. He can determine the role of one person each night.\n\nThe Doctor - There is a Cornarian army doctor on board, identity unknown. He can protect one person every night.\n\nAnd finally, there are the innocent vacationers.\n\nThe Ultra 64 network is divided into three sections, or \"threads\":\n\n-Open Channel: Discuss goings-on here.\n-Voting Booth: Vote for who you suspect here.\n-ROB's Updates: See the results of votes, who the bad guys have killed, etc., here.\n\nEvery day, you vote for who you suspect is loyal to Andross, in the \"Voting Booth\" thread. With the exception of Andross and members of Star Wolf, everyone can vote, including people with roles. Every night, the bad guys can kill one person, Fox can investigate one person, and the doctor can protect one person (via pms).\n\nYou can lie, claim whatever you want, and even reveal your role. However, you are not allowed to quote or show screenshots of pms. While alive, you must post in a mafia thread at least once every 2 days (except over the weekend.) While dead, you must not try to influence the outcome of the game in any way. (While there’s obviously no way of monitoring pms, please honor this rule. It’s important because the bad guys will often kill people to hush them up.)\n\nTo win, you have to stay alive. Apart from that, if you’re innocent, all of the Andross loyalists need to be voted out. If you’re not innocent, innocents need to be killed off until the number of innocents is equal to the number of Andross loyalists."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.063712"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.063712"]]

Or just any forum game to play. Well, since it might be awhile yet until 18 Days posts her mafia and because she kept insisting on calling it Mafia 13, I thought that I would step up into the plate and deliver the long-lost mafia 12. The reason that most people do not discuss mafia 12 is because it is a little bit stupid. Hence the fact that it is funhouse mafia. Yes, mafia 12 is designed to be the shortest mafia game ever. \n\nNow, obviously, it has some competition since the shortest mafia game was 11 and that lasted 5 Days. Fortunately, this game will be even shorter. Yes, it will only last three days automatically. It doesn't matter how many people sign up, there will be mass deaths in order to keep this rule in effect. Best of all, sign-up time is real short. You only get two days to sign-up. Sign-up ends Dec.22 at midnight. Then, the game is played in hectic fashion over the next three days. If you found yourself busy during the holidays already, mafia just came and flipped your world upside down. Yes, this just happened.\n\nMore stress? Sign me up! But wait. How do I play? Thanks for asking Billy. The rules are simple. Simply complex. Yes, although the basic will be in place, mafias, cop, doctor, bomber, townies, there will also be a bunch of crazy things given out that just pop into my head. For instance, in every mafia, there will be two godfathers. One is legitimate and makes hits for the mafia. The other is head of a townie base. Both seek the death of the other. However, if a godfather dies, then that mafia can no longer make any hits. Thus, both godfathers will hope to use the other before killing the other one off. Don't backstab too soon! And maybe the mafia's can elect another godfather. It all depends because crazy crap is going to happen all the time.\n\nBelieve it or not, there's a reason for that. The theme is loosely based on Smash Bros. Except that you can choose any Nintendo character from any game. Yes, Smash Bros. with a funhouse twist. Which charater will reign supreme? I can't wait to find out. Since this is my excuse for the shoddy workmanship done on these rules, it gives me an explanation for said crazy crap. It's like items. They just come out of nowhere for no reason. So, for instance, anyone with the letter o in the name is immune from being filled for the next hour. Random vote. Two people are randomly chosen for no reason. After half an hour, the one with the most votes dies. Not around to save yourself? Thought you could watch Identity for awhile? Too bad. And a bunch of other zany and wacky items like that will also appear throughout the game at anytime. Like choosing a new godfather. Thought I'd forgot about that, didn't you. What? You didn't? Uhhh, quick! Look at the next paragraph.\n\nSo, at this point, I don't think there is anything else I need to explain. All roles will be revealed on the day of playing. There are some other things that will happen behind the scenes that might not come out until after the game is over. Yes, after the amount of people complaing about the rules for mafia 10 and saying I made things too complicated, this is my answer. Not complicated enough. Mafia12 will seperate the real Play-uh's from the players. I don't think that made sense. \n\nBut, how could I forget. Voting will be 24 hours, although, things will slow down a lot when I'm not on at night. Ties will be solved the following ways. Both people who are tied in the voting will die but they get to chose one person to take with them. If you die and then talk about a role and reveal info that would help your team. I.e. Mafia member reveals a townie role or townie reveals a mafia role. The team that was hurt by the information gets to immediately kill 3 people of their choosing in retalition. That should settle everything.\n\nSo, all that's left is for everyone to start flooding the sign-up thread. I hope I made it big enough. If you don't choose a character, one will randomly be assigned to you. Also, I sure as heck ain't makin' no avatars for this game. It doesn't deserve that much work. However, if you want to make your own, go ahead. Otherwise, just put in your signiture what character you are. That's the best homemade solution for this game.\n\nFinal thoughts: Basically, if you want to survive, just kill anyone and everyone you can, because chances are, they're trying to do the same to you. Plus, if you're still standing at the end, chances are you won. "], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.066252"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.066252"]]

I thought about a Kirby theme in honor of TYP butit just didn't seem right. Plus, trivia covers many games. So, in the end I decided to have a theme that encompasses many ganes. And that theme is......\n\nNintendo Villains/Bosses. Yes, choose any Nintendo villain/boss you would like to emulate for this game. I think it will be interesting to see which badguy is the baddest of them of all. I would prefer that a major villain was chosen. i.e. Marx instead if Waddle Dee. (A Kirby reference). But, I know many of you prefer to use the more obscure characters. Regardless, the only criteria will be that everyone chooses or is assigned a Nintendo villain. So, Dr. Robotnik would not work but Bowser would. \n\nRemember, first come, first serve. So grab your favorite villain now.\n\nThe Rules\n\nHow to Play. (If you are familiar with the mafia games already, skip to the gameplay reminders section)\n\nPlaying mafia can be summerized in one word: Survive! As long as you are still alive in the game, chances are you are winning. \n\nOf course, it is a bit more complicated than that. You should remember that there are two sides to a mafia game. You are either a part of the townie side or the mafia side. If you belong to one side, you are looking to eliminate the rival side. How do you kill players.\n\nEveryday there is a vote to choose one person to eliminate from the game. The person with the most votes at the end of the day is killed. Both sides can vote during the day, mafia and townies. However, after the day vote, there is a night action period. During this time, the mafia can send in a hit for whichever person they choose. The townies have no say in the matter. The next day or turn, the townies learn who the mafia killed and the game repeats until one side is left.\n\nThe victory conditions are a bit different for either side. For the townies to win, every mafia member must be eliminated. For the mafia to win, they just need to equal the number of townies left. So, if there are 3 mafia members left and 3 townies, the game is over and the mafia wins. The reason for this is that mafia members are supposed to be so powerful as to overwhelm the townies one-on-one. Obviously, if the townie number is lower than the number of mafia remaining, the mafia wins. A tie is the minimum win condition for the mafia.\n\nIt should be noted that there may be a couple roles that don't fit into either catagory (mafia or townie) and have a different win condition. These roles most also be eliminated before one side can claim victory.\n\nFinally, since it is a prize edition, this should be stated clearly. If the townies won, not every townie would get the prize. Only those townies who are alive at the end of the game would get to claim the prize. It is just the same as any other mafia game where only townies alive at the end get to count a victory. With the mafia, you can count a victory even if you are dead so long as the rest of the mafia is able to win. However, because of the prize being involved, only the mafia members still alive at the end of the game would be eligible for the prize.\n\nVoting Rules\n\nEveryday, a new thread will be created for each day the game lasts. In this thread, you can cast a vote for whomever you want. To do so, simply type in bold \"VOTE (Name)\" where name is the person you are voting for. You can only vote for one person so votes for different people will not be counted. If you wish to change your vote at anytime, simply edit your message and erase the vote. There will be a deadline each day for when votes can be cast. Once the deadline is reached, all votes are binding. If you change or edit a vote after the deadline, the new vote will not be counted and the old vote will remain as your choice instead. \n\nGameplay Reminders\n\nI am going to stick with the long voting hours I introduced in Mafia 10. So, basically, the voting thread will be open for 21-22 hours. This gives everyone in all time zones a fair chance to play.\n\nBreaking voting ties. \n\nIf there is a tie at the end of the day's vote, I will leave the thread open a bit past the deadline for a length of time afterwards. I will list then how much extra time will be given as circumstances may vary for me. No more than half an hour. During this extra time, any player can change their vote if they wish. As well, any player who hadn't voted that day may then cast a vote. The first vote that breaks the tie ends the voting. The person with the most votes will then be killed. \n\nIf however, the remaining time has expired and the vote is still tied, the players who are tied are all killed. However, those players get to choose one person who voted for them to die with them. Thus, you may want to avoid ties.\n\nRevealing someone's role after you are out of the game.\n\nIf you are eliminated and then give away someone's role, (i.e. Mafia member reveals a townie player's identity or townie reveals a mafia player's identity) the team that was hurt by the information gets to immediately kill 3 people of their choosing in retalition. Do ont think you can create a loophole of this rule by hurting someone on your own team (i.e. Mafia member reveals another mafia member's identity). In this case, you are stupid.\n\nGiving out information.\n\nIf you wish to tell the players of the game a message, you have a couple of legal channels to do so. One, you can post this information in the voting thread or two you can send a private message to players. You can not, however, create another account and use it to hide your identity while giving out information. If you want to say something, you must accept the responsibility of being known as saying it.\n\n\nThat should about cover the rules for playing the game. If there is something you are still confused about or something I didn't mention that you think should be covered, you can let me know by sending me a message or just posting it in this thread.

But it is not based on that movie alone. Rather, I felt it was the best title for this theme. The Wild West. Yes sir, for Mafia 19, we're doing it old school. So, let's get out back story started.\n\nThe Story\n\nPrologue:\n\nThe evening sun was bleeding out its final light on the day. Sheriff Rock Williams watched the sky. It had been another long day that kept getting worse and he was thankful that it was finally over. Another two ranchers had been found dead today. The work of Col. Sancho Volonté and his bandits. They had been terrorizing this countryside for a month now with great success. With the deaths of Stevens and Baker today, there were few, if any, who would dare openly oppose Volonté's gang now. \n\nIndeed, Rock had already seen the effect the news of the deaths had on the townsfolk. Paranoia, fear and helplessness. It was on everyone's faces. It was expressed by everyone's body language. The deaths today seemed to signal the end of a war. Defeat. That's what it was. Defeat was what everyone felt. Volonté had won and he was now the lord of this county. \n\nRock sighed. Had he been responsible for this? He had been sheriff for so long now. Had he gotten too old? Too tired? Too lax? He had the respect and admiration of the townsfolk for so many years. But more importantly, he had their trust. Not automatically but because he earned. Because he had fought hard to preserve its citizens and to protect their freedom. Success after success. Anyone who dared start trouble didn't last long. But was the relative peace that everyone had enjoyed for some time the cause of this? Was it because there had been no trouble for so long, that he now forgot how to deal with it? Had success made Rock ignorant that he might be defeated? \n\nRock knew that his reaction to Volonté had not been swift when his band started causing trouble. In fact, Rock knew now that he had underestimated the threat of this group. That slow start is no doubt why it felt like Rock he was always trying to catch up to Volonté; why it felt Volonté was always ahead of him. And today, the truth about Volonté and his band had finally been revealed to Rock. \n\nAfter the death of Stevens and Baker had been conveyed to the town, Rock quickly gathered a posse to follow the trail left behind by Volonté and his men. It was more just a token show of force. Nothing had come of the other times he had rode out against this group. But it appears success had also affected Volonté and his men as this time, they did leave a trail behind and only halfheartedly attempted to throw people off it. After following the trail for some time it eventually looped back towards the town. This concerned Rock since he feared the band may have felt brazen enough to now attack the town in broad daylight. Rock and his posse kept following the trail as it came closer and closer to town. And then he was unable to follow it any longer as it joined the main road leading into the town. It appeared Volonté had decided on riding into town after all. Rock and the posse quickly sped back to the town to see if everyone was all right.\n\nThey were. There had been no disturbance in the town since he rode out. Puzzled, Rock tried to figure out what had happened. He followed the main road some more but there was no sign of Volonté and his men's trail coming off the main road after they got on it. How could they have just vanished? They couldn't have gone back on the road or they would have been spotted by Rock and his posse. But if they went forwards and into town, they would have spotted which is something they had avoided. No one had yet been able to give a description of Volonté and his men for anyone that saw them was killed. Since no reported seeing any strangers on the road, Rock couldn't figure out what had happened. Until Maria came.\n\nAs John Baxter, the town's doctor, came out of the house and on to the porch, Rock turned away from his view of the starry night sky to hear the verdict.\n\n\"How is she?\" Rock asked.\n\n\"She's dead,\" John flatly responded.\n\nRock sighed again, his shoulders limp and head to the floor. \"Hell,\" he whispered. It was all he could think of saying.\n\n\"Care to tell me what happened to her?\" John asked.\n\n\"Volonté,\" Rock answered.\n\n\"I could surmise that. But why her?\" John pressed, \"What did Maria do?\"\n\n\"It wasn't Maria they were after. It was her husband,\" Rock replied.\n\n\"Henry? He's not a wealthy fellow. He barely gets by month after month. What would Volonté have wanted from him?\" John asked.\n\nRock raised his eyes up from the floor and faced John again. \"I'll let you know. Not just you but the whole town tomorrow. When you ride back tonight, let everyone know that Sheriff Rock Williams has an announcement to make about Col. Sancho Volonté and his gang. Tell them that I have a solution to this problem also and that Volonté's reign of terror is coming to an end,\" Rock steely explained.\n\n\"Alright Rock. But you better mean it. This town is running out of hope fast,\" John said.\n\n\"I mean it,\" Rock replied. Then he got on his horse and rode home. John Baxter watched him ride off for a bit and then saddled up on to his horse and rode into to town.

There's the mafia, ruthless killers, thieves, and conspirators.  They work covertly and kill at night.  In this game, Mrs. Wormwood, Good Calvin, Rosalyn, Moe, and Mr. Lockjaw comprise our mafia.  Their goal?  To kill or control all the townies.  To do this, their numbers must equal or be higher than the remaining townies, with both the Killer and the Suicide Bomber dead.\n\nThen there's the townies.  The normal, good natured citizens of the city.  They work hard, sweat and toil, only to find evil amidst them.  In this game, Calvin, Hobbes, Calvin's Mom, Calvin's Dad, Uncle Max, Stupendous Man, and Spaceman Spiff comprise the townies.  Their goal is to rid the town of the aggressive, secret oppressors, the mafia, by killing them all.\n\nEach day, everyone in the town votes to kill a member of the town, or if the townies elect, they can choose not to vote as well.  The player with the most votes at the end of the day is lynched.\n\nIn this specific game of Mafia, we're playing with Calvin and Hobbes characters, locations, items, and motives.  When a player is killed, he is hit with one of Calvin's new Transmogrifier rays, which is now permanent.  The player will then turn into something else, like a worm or a lamp, and will no longer be allowed to participate in the game in any way.\n\nIn this game, there are several roles.  The descriptions in the post below describe how players with the said roles win and lose.  All players who do not receive a role in the post below will be Calvin's Classmates, who, caught in the middle of an incident bigger than Noodles, just don't want to turn into lions, tigers, bears, or anything like that.  The roles will be edited for clarity as needed, but there probably won't be any major changes at this point.  Calvin's Classmates are on the townie side.\n\nThe setting is the panels of Calvin and Hobbes.  Anywhere that occurs in the strips can be in this game.  The camping grounds, the school, or anywhere is available.\n\nTime passes during the game of mafia similarly to how time passes in real life.  The game is divided into two sections, night and day.  During the day, generally the only major event that occurs is the vote.  Each player may vote for a player to kill of his or her choosing.  In this game, immediately after the day ends, the vote ends, and the player with the most votes is killed.  In the event of a tie, no tie-breaker time will be allotted.  instead, the two people who lose the vote will send me a PM of one person they'd each like to kill, then 3/4 of the players that were voted for/picked will die, at random.  Yes, this means you can tie in the vote, pick any player you want to die, and still live, it's just unlikely that this would happen.  Also during the day, all night actions need to be PM'ed to me.  I will not accept any late night actions.\n\nDuring the night, several things take place.  After planning their moves during the day, all the roled players who have night abilities will act, believe it or not, simultaneously.  For example, if the mafia's hit ends up on Calvin's Mom, and she chooses to mend Hobbes that night, then she dies, but Hobbes is also mended.  This all takes place after a player is voted out, so if Calvin's Mom decided to mend Hobbes, but is then voted out, Hobbes will not be mended.\n\nIn this game, the day will be considered \"Class Time,\" and the night will be considere \"Out of School\""], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.090423"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.090423"]]

Why did she get up early again?  Oh yeah!  She knew it was supposed to rain today, the best time to hook an elusive Coelacanth.  After cramming her fishing pole into her dress, she made her way outside.  As the news had forecasted, a steady rain was falling.  Pulling out her stylish umbrella, she skipped merrily down to the beach.  Once there, she started walking as to avoid scaring away her unsuspecting prey.  A shadow!  She cast her line in the direction the shadow was looking.  The fish then turned and swam the other direction!  \"Augh!,\" she murmured, as she cast her line again....and again...and again...Finally she hooked the fish!  \"A SEABASS?  WHAT THE ****!?\"  As she chucked the fish back into the sea she caught a face-full of tail.  But Tangy wasn't about to give up.  She caught another sea bass, and another...and another...\"Where are all the good fish!?,\" she cried out in disgust.  Then a unusually large shadow caught her eye.  She cast her line, and she hooked.  As she quickly reeled in her catch, her twinkling eyes turned to confusion, and then to fear.  What she had reeled in was not a fish, but the body of a recently murdered villager.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWelcome to the world of Animal Crossing...Town Name: Vale...Population: Diminishing\n\nLet me introduce myself.  I am the Mayor of Vale, Mayor Khushrenada.  As you can see, Vale isn't exactly your usual, friendly Animal Crossing town.  Rather, we've pulled in some dark individuals that thrive on ambition and deceit...And I don't just mean the usual \"tree choppers.\"  It's not a secret that the local monopolizing raccoon, Tom Nook, and his trusty \"Crooked Cranny 'Coons\" are at war with Black Market veteran Crazy Redd; bodies are found all the time!  And if that were bad enough, I've been receiving suicide bomb threats for the past few weeks!  But no matter, I've decided enough is enough...All of the villagers will be locked inside the town until this matter is sorted out.  Good luck to all of you...\n\n~Mayor Khushrenada\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow the prologue is out of the way, let me introduce you to the roles of the game!\n\nMayor Khushrenada - That's me, your loving grandfather figure!  I'll be monitoring your progress and tallying your votes...\n\nCrooked Cranny 'Coons - The \"top dog\" gang in town...The Godfather, Tom Nook, has been monopolizing the market for years.  Because they don't know the members of the Black Market Foxes, they will take out everyone in the town with them, but only on odd days...(Tom Nook's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nBlack Market Foxes - The Godfather of this gang, Crazy Redd, decided to take advantage of Tom Nook's price gouging monopoly a few months back, and has been undercutting the prices of all of Nook's goods (legal and not-so legal) ever since...Like the 'Coons, they wish to get rid of their enemy as soon as possible...They will make hits on even days...(Crazy Redd's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nDetective Copper - our local cop has taken it upon himself to locate the members of each gang and bring them to justice.  Being the perfectionist he is, he only investigates the identity of one town member each night.\n\nMint - This spunky squirrel gets around town faster than anyone, and if you've played Animal Crossing, you know just how fast it is to get around town...With her powers of \"persuasion,\" she is able to sway a close vote in the direction she desires every night...\n\nBlanca - A mysterious foreigner made her way into town before the gates were closed.  She can steal the face of a single person at any point in the game (overnight), killing the original owner of the role in the process...If Blanca ends up wishing to kill someone who is being targetted by Death or Mafia, Blanca will reach the victim first...If Blanca kills Cube, she will die...\n\nK.K. Slider - The local guitar-strumming legend is also an ally of justice...Upset at the general lack of motivation of the Villagers in tracking down the scum of Vale, he's become a vigilante...He has enough time to plan one attack on a single person every night, but if kills an innocent his life is forfeit...\n\nDeath AKA Mr. Resetti - Who we believe to be a very strict anti-reset mole is actually a messenger from above...He can leave his hole every night to kill one person of his choice...However, if he kills Sable, he will forfeit his position in this world as well...EDIT: I forgot to note that Detective Copper sees Death as a Villager as well...\n\nGuardian Angel AKA Sable - The calm seamstress is the second messenger sent from the other side...She knows the intentions of Death every night, and can protect a single person from Death's touch over the course of the game...otherwise, she can protect one person a night...I guess it's also important to note that Detective Copper is not a medium (one who can see ghosts), and thus Sable's identity to him is \"Villager\"...\n\nCube the Suicide Penguin - This crazy penguin is the most dangerous character of the game, and there is no reasoning for his threats...\n- can choose 2 people to kill on one night, but he also dies\n- if he is killed over-night, the person that killed him also dies\n- if he is voted off, all of those who voted for him will die\n\nBomber's Apprentice - Unfortunately, Cube has taken in an apprentice...When or if Cube dies, his protege will take over the role of Suicide Bomber...It is also important to note that the Apprentice could be ANYONE in the game, even if they already have a role...If the Apprentice has another role, their other role will be their identity if they are investigated...\n\nVillagers - Innocent townies who just want to live the rest of their lives fishing, gardening, and insect catching in peace...\n\nThe game will begin two Mondays from now, Feb. 9...This should be a fun game, so be as creative as you wish!

Gadd was working in his lab on what was to be the pinnacle of his career: The \"Super Heated Reticulation Ocular Oscillation Mega-gun\" or S.H.R.O.O.M. Gun. which, if working correctly, could could turn ANY mushroom into a Power Mushroom!  Mario had to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser three times this year, and was beginning to run low on his back stock of Power Mushrooms.  \n\nThe good professor got up from his chair and headed over to his bag of standard, regular plain-ol mushrooms.  He reached in the bag, pulled out a mushroom, and gave it a good once over.  It smelled like a normal mushroom, it LOOKED like a normal mushroom, and after a quick bite - it tasted like a normal mushroom.  He gave out a triumphant whoop and raced back to his desk.  He placed the mushroom on his desk, and took a few steps back, with the S.H.R.O.O.M. gun in hand.  He fired the gun at the mushroom and then BOOM!  \n\nThere was a white light... it seemed to last forever, but in reality, it was only maybe a minute.  When the light subsided, he peered at the mushroom.  Nothing had changed!  His device hadn't worked!  \n\nBut wait.... as he walked toward the mushroom, he noticed something was different.  He looked down at his legs and screeched - his pants had transformed!  Also his shoes.  Professor E. Gadd was suddenly filled with dread, and raced over to a mirror.  ACK!  He looked just like Toad!  He reached over to his shelf and grabbed a picture that was taken shortly after last month's great rescue of Princess Peach.  The picture contained Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad.  And after a quick comparison, YES!  E. Gadd was suddenly IDENTICAL to Toad!  \n\nE. Gadd felt very strange, and went back to his desk to go over the plans for his device.  What had caused this?  Were there any other side effects?  \n\nIt was only a few minutes later when he heard a very loud knocking at his door.  He went to answer the door and was completely taken aback by what he saw: Dozens upon Dozens of clones of TOAD!  The gun had transformed the ENTIRE MUSHROOM KINGDOM into clones of Toad!  How strange!\n\nOne of the toads came forward, wearing a nametag that said \"My Name Is Actually Princess Peach\".  She was furious at the professor and started throwing vegetables at him.  He wasn't sure how she got a hold of so many vegetables, but now wasn't the time to question!\n\n\"People of the Mushroom Kingdom, I understand you're upset!  I will have NO problem transforming you all back to your normal selves, but I will need some time!   I happen to have the formula for a potion that will undo what I've done, but I will only be able to make one dose a day! For now, you've all got name tags!  That should help!\"\n\nIt was then that the Toad who called himself \"Princess Peach\" described what had been happening down at the castle when everything had gone awry - Bowser had launched a full on assault! Bowser, as well as a number of Koopa Troopa, the Hammer Bros, and Bob-omb were all inside the castle when everyone was changed.\"\n\n\"We have no way of knowing who is who, except for to take their word on it!\"\n\nE. Gadd knew he was in for a stressful week..."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.119520"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.119520"]]

As the first major celebrity of the Punch-Out tournament, this ear biting maniac has a lot of clout  He has the ability to knock out one player a night by sending his fellow mafia henchmen  He must choose himself, or a specific henchman to perform the hit.  If Mike Tyson is eliminated from the game, one of the mafia members will ascend to his throne.  This is done via a vote amongst the remaining Mafia members.    Mike Tyson will appear as \"Townie\" if he is investigated.  ONLY Mike Tyson can perform a hit on Mr. Dream without being knocked out.\n\nMafia Members - Will be dependent on how many sign up. But there will be two roles within the membership\n\nGreat Tiger- Not only is he is a veteran of the ring but he has what some consider supernatural powers. Utilizing his hypnotic powers, Great Tiger is able to read one person's role ONCE during the game. So make sure you choose wisely.\n\nDon Flamenco- Using his mesmerizing dance routine he has made hearts melt, both male and female. Once during the game Don Flamenco can choose to dance into the heart of the townies winning the knowledge of 2 random roles from the townie alliance. The only problem is that he sometimes can't help himself from being wooed himself if his name comes out 4 times out 5 flips and a random mafia role will have to be given up for everyone to see (Isn't love beautiful?). Will he be willing to take that chance? If his charms work, the random townie roles will be given ONLY to him, and the only individuals that are impervious to his charms are Mr. Dream, Big Bertha, and Bald Bull. Oh did I forget to mention that if Great Tiger's power is used, that discovered role WILL be included in the random list of potential townie role reveals so there is a chance he may only get back one unknown role? \n\nIf Tyson is taken out a mafia member can ascend to Godfather by a majority the vote. The only catch is that the mafia will not get a knock out that night.\n\nImposter- Super Macho Man\n\nHis experience in the ring under different ring leaders lends itself nicely to him being able to impersonate any role he chooses.. He can choose one person a night to impersonate.  If that person is the same person that  Mr. Dream investigates, then that investigation will come back \"Mafia\" even if the person is innocent.\n\n\nTownie Roles:\n\nInvestigator - Mr. Dream\n\nAfter seeing a resurgence of Mike Tyson in the Punch-Out!! tournament, Mr. Dream has decided the best course of action was to take the \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" approach and has joined up the Little Mac Clone Townie Alliance Punch-Out!! Force.  Using his influence and fear tactics he can get anyone (except Mike Tyson himself) to confess their allegiance.  He can investigate any player once a night and will learn their role.  The only Tyson Mafia member who can knock out Mr. Dream safely is Mike Tyson himself.  If any other Tyson Mafia members attempt to hit Mr. Dream, they will be knocked out along with Mr. Dream\n\nProtector - Doc Louis\n\nDoc  has always been on Little Mac's side, and helping protect those in the Little Mac Clone Townie Alliance was a no brainier for him.  Doc will choose one player to protect from death by Mafia hit, Bald Bull suicide charge, or a Big Bertha knock out attempt, so that player will be saved from being knocked out unconscious.  Doc cannot prevent knock out caused by placing a hit on, or voting out, Big Bertha.  Doc cannot protect himself from knock out.\n\nSaint - King Hippo\n\nThe Little Mac Clone Townie Alliance loves this big lovable loose short heavyweight. If they can't knock his pants off, no one can . If King Hippo is voted out by the players, then the player who INITIALLY cast a vote for King Hippo will be lynched and killed immediately.  If a player stars the bandwagon, but later changers their vote, then they are still responsible for the bandwagon.  Start your bandwagons carefully.\n\nVote changer - Glass Joe\n\nAfter multiple embarrassments and a pathetic win-loss record, Glass Joe has had enough. He will do what he can to influence other people's matches.   Glass Joe can use the pity he has received throughout his life to change a single vote once a day.  He can cancel a vote out, or change the name on the vote.  Glass Joe's ability does not affect King Hippo's ability.  Much like a player cannot change their vote to un-bandwagon themselves, Glass Joe cannot un-bandwagon a player.  He submits his choice at night.  \n\nLittle Mac Prime:\nThe trouble with having tons of Little Mac clonesrunning around is that the original has gotten lost in the shuffle.Will the real Little Mac please stand up? This is a special role that will be activated on an already predetermined date. A random normal townie will be awarded the ability to have ONE knock-out of ANY character in the game without any fear of being knocked out himself, this includes the Bomber role as well. As stated though, this is a one time ability which will be activated later on. The only catch is that if this player is a recipient of one of the two bomber suicide choices, a Godfather or killer hit, or a vote by the peeps his action will be null and void and will be knocked out of the game.\n\nOther Roles:\n\nKiller- Big Bertha\n    The punch-out tournament has been a male only event ever since its inception. Big Bertha's goal is to show the men that a female can hang with the best of them. She will do whatever it takes to prove to the world that women can kick butt as well. Each night Big Bertha can take out one participant of her choosing.\n\n\nBomber- Bald Bull\nBald Bull is not afraid to put his head down and rush towards danger. The only problem is that he leaves himself wide open. If Bald Bull is voted out, he will take out a random half of those who voted for him.  If he is taken out by the mafia, he will take out the Godfather of the mafia. If he is take out by Big Bertha, Big Bertha will go with him.  Bald Bull also can take out any two members of his choosing at any time, but that action will also take Bald Bull with them. If Bald Bull loses a vote by his peers, that will supercede his two person sacrificial knockout blow. On the flip side he can utilize his sacrificial knockout EVEN IF a hit is put out on him that same night\n\n\nWin conditions:\n\nTyson MAFIA: Eliminate all townies until the number of townies is equal or lesser to the number of Mafia. Eliminate Big Bertha. Eliminate Bald Bull.\n\nPunch-Out Townies: Eliminate all members of the Mafia.  Eliminate Big Bertha, the killer. Also eliminate the bomber, Bald Bull\n\nKiller: Be the last woman standing.\n\nBomber- Be the last man standing, or responsible for knocking out the last remaining players. \n\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.122249"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.122249"]]

The objective is to find each teams \"flags\" and capture them or eliminate them from play.  \n\nThe 3 teams are:  Team Mario, Team Bowser, and Team Wario.\n\nOk, just thought I would post the order of events just in case people want to know.\n\nThe Days vote is always the first action to occur.\nThe next action to occur is always Wario's action if he chooses to act.\nThe following action will occur in the order that I get them.  So runners and gunners actions will be processed in the order they were received.\n\nNight actions like investigations and General's identity change occur the beginning of next day.  As such, a General can not investigate someone AND change roles the same day...it is one or the other.\n\nTeam Mario and Team Bowser are the two largest teams.  They are playing against each other to see who can beat the other in paintball.  Each team will have designated Flags which will know each other and will work together to try to rally their team for a win.  \n\nTeam Wario is a wildcard team that is just up for mischief and want to disrupt the game in whatever way they can.  The Wario team's size is unknown, but they don't have any flags because they are not part of the tournament.  To win Team Wario needs to eliminate both teams before they are capable of defeating the other team.  This can be done by capturing the last flag of each team at the same time, or eliminating all the players on a team except for the flags.  \n\nBasic Roles:\n\nFlags:  Are a special Role on Team Mario and Team Bowser.  The Flags know who each other are and act to a similar way to mafia in traditional games.  The Mario Flags know each other, but can not attack with guns.  They can only be eliminated by either Vote Out, Capture, or Team Wario Attack.  The game is over when all the flags on one team is eliminated.  There will either be 3 to 4 flags per team.\n\nFlags: must rely on their knowledge of their team to lead votes and try to protect each other.  They truly are the leaders of their team, but be careful who you trust, because you may be talking to the enemy.\n\nGunners:  The Gunners are the most basic role of the game (they are the townies of the game)  Gunners start out with 5 paintballs each for the entire game.  They can choose to use all their paintballs at once or save them for later in the game.  Each paintball has a 25% chance of hittings its target.  You can increase the odds by shooting up to 3 paintballs at a single target.  So 1 paintballs = 25%, 2 paintballs = 50%, and 3 Paintballs = 75% of hitting your target.  There is always a chance of avoiding an attack.  \n\nGunners do not have any idea who anyone is on their team.  They don't know who each other are or their flags.  So it you must be careful who you trust and who you target.  Once you run out of paintballs all you can do is vote.  \n\nRunners: do not have a paintball gun, but they can capture flags from the other team with their action.  If a runner captures a flag, the captured flag is eliminated from the game, and the runner becomes a new flag for their team.  Once they are a flag, they will be informed who the rest of their team's flags are.  Runners can turn the tables on a game, by allowing the team to strength from a weakened position, and stay in the game.\n\nGenerals aka MARIO & BOWSERl   The General has the ability to become any Role for a team, except a flag.  Once the general has chosen a role he is no longer a General and becomes that new role with all their abilities.  While he is the General (and not chosen a role) the General can investigate one person each night and determine what role they have and what team they are on.  Unfortunately as the General he can not attack.\n\n\n\nTeam Wario\n\nTeam Wario are special roles that have only 2 weapons.  1 is a Paintball gun with a 100% hit ratio.  This paint gun can take out a flag or a gunner.  The other weapon is a Paint grenade.  The Paint Grenade can target 2 opponents of their choice and has a 100% accuracy.  The Paint Grenade is the perfect weapon for Team Wario to achieve their goal of eliminating both teams final flags.  Team Wario can only be eliminated by vote out.  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nActions:\n\nAll Roles have the responsibility to vote in the daily thread.  If you do not vote in a thread you will not die.  However, if you do not vote and you are a gunner you will lose a paintball.  This will encourage everyone to participate in the daily thread vote.  Besides, this game is going to be fast and furious so it is important to start voting soon.\n\nGunners:  Gunners send a private message to me to target their shots.  Once they send in their shots it can not be edited or changed.   This is because I will be determining my actions by the order they come to me.  Private Messages can start coming in the second I start the new day.  If you send them in earlier I will not count that action.  To be fair to my overseas players, before the game starts you can write me a special request to send actions in early.  This must be arranged before the game starts, and the private message needs to be sent to me over the night before the new day starts.  Otherwise, I will treat it like any other action in that order.  You will not be told if your actions hit, miss, or hit a flag.  You will just have to make assumptions based on what happens in the game.\n\nRunners:  Your actions are night actions, so before the start of each day you send in your actions and they will occur first thing the start of the next day.  So that means day 0, you can send in a target.  If you target a flag for your action then you capture that flag and take them out of the game.   The target is out of the game, and you become the flag.  This works for targeting opposing flags, and targeting your own flags, so be careful who you target.   Once you are a flag you are not a runner anymore and will be informed of the other flags on your team.  If you target anyone else, your action fails.\n\nSpies actions are night actions, so before the start of each day send in a player you would like to investigate, at the beginning of the day you will learn that players role and what team they are one.  This means before day 1 begins you can send in a target on 'day 0'\n\nGeneral's The general's actions are night actions to change roles.  However, once you change roles you have to wait until next day to use your new role.  So on Day 1 Night if you become a Gunner you can not use your attacks for Day 2.  You must wait til Day 3.\n\nTeam Wario:  Your actions are always night actions.  This means your actions will always have precedence over all other attacks.  This gives you a big advantage.  You can also send in your actions if you choose on 'day 0' for a day 1 action.  But remember you only have 2 actions the entire game.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClarification # 1)  Although the vote is one of the few ways to eliminate a flag.  Anyone role voted out is out of the game.   \n\n8 Members Team Mario/Team Bowser\n\n3-Flags Each Team\n1-General Each Team\n2-Runner Each Team\n2-Gunners Each Team\n\nThe Leaves 1 Member for Team Wario. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk, just thought I would post the order of events just in case people want to know.\n\nThe Days vote is always the first action to occur.\nThe next action to occur is always Wario's action if he chooses to act.\nThe following action will occur in the order that I get them.  So runners and gunners actions will be processed in the order they were received.\n\nNight actions like investigations and General's identity change occur the beginning of next day.

First of all there is no actual mafia team; effectively both teams are townies. All members will be assigned an item to use according to the rules. These items will be replaced the next day upon their use.\n\nAll players start with 3 points.\nTo die, you must be voted out in the day actions or you must have your points depleted by being attacked by other players to zero.\n\nAll players are effectively townies; however they are affiliated to different teams. All players will have assigned items that are replaced the next day following its use (except the Green Team).\n\nThere are three teams: \nRed Team\nBlue Team\nGreen Team\n\nThe Red and Blue Teams will have equal amounts of players, while the Green Team has a smaller number of players. To compensate for a smaller team, all actions the Green Team make takes priority over all others.\nAs the green team has priority their action would be placed first regardless of whether it really was or not. So, for instance, if a green player and red player remained and both has 1 point remaining, and they both fired red shells at each other then the red player would die first.\n\nFor either the Red or Blue Teams to win, the opposing team plus the Green Team must die. For the Green Team to win, they must defeat all the members of either team (only one team). \n\nTo clarify:\nNobody will know who other members are (except for Green Team, who will know other Green players).\nFor the Red Team to win, they must defeat half the members of the Blue Team and AT LEAST HALF OF the Green Team.\nFor the Blue Team to win, they must defeat half the members of the Red Team and AT LEAST HALF OF the Green Team. (So, if the opposing team has 10 this must be reduced to 5 for Red/Blue to win)\nFor the Green Team to win, they must defeat half the members of the Red Team OR the Blue Team. (So, for example if Red Team has 10, Green need to reduce that number to 5 for Green to win)\n\nGreen must maintain at least half of their team, and not fall below this. I.E If they had 10, then 6 is the minimum.\n\nITEMS:\n\nBOTH TEAMS:\nRed Shell - Removes one point from nominated person. Can be used offensively or defensively.\n\nBlue Shell - Removes one point from all opposing team. All weapons ineffective except Star and POW.\nBanana - Protects against all offensive items except blue shells and POW.\n\nMystery Box - Removes one point from nominated person. Can only be used offensively.\n\nCoin - Restores one point to nominated person. Same day use. Alive players only.\n\nIdentifier - Allows user to find out who has what type of item. (e.g. \"Who has the Blue Shell?\"). The risk is if you use the item, you will have your answer and you will switch team.\n\nCloud - Removes 2 points from owner unless one point is used to transfer to someone else. Can only be transferred once. Cloud ‘attacks’ after second day.\n\nOil Spill – Randomises the points of 2 people.\nLightning - Cancels all votes on opposing team (can also cancel green votes), except for one person.\n\nThe Green Team will have 4 items for the entire game:\nBoo\nPOW\n2 x Red shells\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.128156"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.128156"]]

It's good to see you are catching on to the importance of this.\n \nPhoenix: *I wouldn't go that far with congratulations yet*\n \nMaya: Now hurry up before it is too late.\n \nPhoenix: Uhh, hurry up for what?\n \nMaya: To get down to The Pyropizm Corporation to investigate for clues before the police find them all.\n \nPhoenix: *uh, isn't it the job of the police to find them all?*\n \nMaya: Quit daydreaming and start moving!\n \nPhoenix: *sigh. Why do I have a feeling I'm going to regret this.* Alright, lead the way.\n \nMaya: Yay! With us on the case, this mystery will be solved in no time. Do you think we'll be able to stop by Bridget Publishing also?\n \nPhoenix: I don't think you'll let me decide either way.\n \nMaya: Come on Nick. You know I always value your thoughts.\n \nPhoenix: Thanks Maya.\n \nMaya: Now enough talking, more sleuthing!\n \nPhoenix: *How about more attorneying instead?*\n \n-----------------------------\nNovember 21, 10:10 AM\nThe Pyropizm Corporation\nOutside Lobby Entrance\n-----------------------------\n \nPhoenix: *This police tape must mean we've reached the spot. There's an outline of where Bill hit the ground. You can still some traces of blood. Sends a shiver up my spine*\n \n? ? ?: Hey pal! Not so close!\n \nPhoenix: *I only need one guess as to who that voice belongs to*\n \nMaya: Detective Gumshoe!\n \nGumshoe: Oh, it's you pal. I didn't recognize you from the back.\n \nPhoenix: *I don't think Gumshoe would have recognized me if he had approached from the front either* Detective Gumshoe. Are you investigating Bill's death?\n \nGumshoe: You bet I am, pal! It hasn't been easy but we've managed to apprehend the culprit.\n \nPhoenix: *Apprehend the culprit already? Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe more.*\n \n*Phoenix selects Talk*\n \n*Phoenix selects \"The Victim\"*\n \nPhoenix: So what do you know about this Bill, Gumshoe?\n \nMaya: Nick! How can you say a thing like that? Especially when I already told you who he was! You know who he is, don't you detective?\n \nGumshoe: Heh. Oh yeah, sure. I think everyone around has heard of Bill Aurion. He's world famous.\n \nPhoenix: *So why am I always the last in the world to hear about these people?* Famous for his business?\n \nGunshoe: Not just that. He's also famous for his love of Japan and his eccentric personal life.\n \nPhoenix: *Eccentric personal life?\"\n \n*Phoenix selects \"Personal Life\"*\n \nPhoenix: What do you mean, \"eccentric personal life\"?\n \nGumshoe: Ah, well, come on pal. Surely you've heard in the news before. He liked to surf the internet using girl pictures for his personal icons. And then there's his collection of, well, panties.\n \nPhoenix: Panties?\n \nMaya: What's wrong with that?\n \nPhoenix: Umm, nothing I guess. It just seems a little odd, don't you think?\n \nMaya: I own a lot of panties. Does that make me odd to you?\n \nPhoenix: *I don't think she's getting the point*\n \nMaya: Not to mention, a lot of that is just rumor.\n \nGumshoe: Oh yeah. I remember that speculation started when Bill ran for office against Honest Unclebob.\n \nMaya: In fact, there were some rumors that it was Unclebob who encouraged people to send Bill panties to help spread that belief.\n \nPhoenix: *Honest Unclebob. How can you trust a name like that?*\n \n*Phoenix selects \"The Culprit\"*\n \nPhoenix: You said you had arrested the culprit. How did you find him so fast?\n \nGumshoe: Oh, that's the most interesting part, pal. Bill had a knife in his back. Before he fell, he was stabbed.\n \nMaya: Stabbed? By whom?\n \nGumshoe: We took the knife to investigate. Turns out it is a pretty rare knife. In fact, there's only one person who owns a knife like that. Ian Sane.\n \nMaya: Ian Sane? I should have known.\n \nPhoenix: *Here we go again* Who's Ian Sane?\n \nMaya: Who's Ian Sane? Come on Nick. Surely, you have to know who that is. Ian Sane is the owner for a chain of magazines the most notable being The Rebuttal. Are you sure it's him Detective?\n \nGumshoe: Absolutely pal. Not only did the knife belong to him, it also had his fingerprints all over it. Moreover, a witness spotted him leaving Bill's office shortly after Bill fell from his top story office.\n \nMaya: That does seem pretty conclusive.\n \nGumshoe: You bet it does pal. And Detective Gumshoe always follows the evidence.\n \n*Phoenix selects \"Ian Sane\"*\n \nPhoenix: Tell me a little more about this Ian Sane person? What is he like?\n \nGumshoe: Well, he has a pretty strong personality. He's not afraid to speak his mind on many issues even if it is an unpopular view. I'm afraid it tends to rub people the wrong way and as such, he's not too well liked.\n \nMaya: Plus, he's the owner of a bunch of magazine companies like \"Another Perspective\", \"WWE History\", \"Pikmin Gardening Weekly\", and of course, \"The Rebuttal\".\n \nPhoenix: *That's a random array of titles* Why would he want to kill Bill?\n \nGumshoe: Well, last month, Ian wrote an article in \"The Rebuttal\" criticizing the way Mario, president of Disaster Relief, ran his organization. He thought it was ridiculous that Disaster Relief would only open up certain branches in different parts of the world and leave others neglected. Bill was a friend of Mario's and took his friend's side in the argument. It lead to some pretty heated debates in the papers.\n \nMaya: I think he only prints that stuff to get a reaction and get more sales. I hardly agree with any of the things he says.\n \nGumshoe: Me either. Each month, when I read his latest Editorial, I want to write back a whole bunch of rebuttals myself.\n \nMaya: Me too. It gets me wound up.\n \nPhoenix: Uh, then quit buying it.\n \nGumshoe: Are you kidding, pal? If I did that, what would happen to the motivation it gives me to fight for my opinion.\n \nMaya: Yeah. It helps me better realize how I feel on different topics.\n \nPhoenix: *Then why can't I figure out how you feel about him*\n \nGumshoe: Well, I have to go pal. The prosecution wants to talk to me about the case. Don't go messing up the crime scene while I'm gone now.\n \nMaya: And he's gone. Let's touch and poke everything we can.\n \nPhoenix: Good idea.\n \n*Phoenix messes up the entire crime scene*\n \nMaya: I found something!\n \nPhoenix: What it is it?\n \nMaya: A needle. I was digging through this garbage can and pushed my hand right into it. Should we put it into evidence?\n \nPhoenix: I'm not so sure it's going to be useful to us.\n \nMaya: Everything's spinning. I need to lay down for awhile.\n \nPhoenix: Don't worry. I've called for an ambulance. I must admit, it is weird waiting for it to come to me instead of me chasing it. RIMSHOT!\n \n*Phoenix gives the needle to the medical personal*\n \nPhoenix: Well, I can't find anything here. Maybe Gumshoe really did find all the clues this time.\n\n? ? ?: Psst. Over here.\n \nPhoenix: Who said that? Gah! There's a man waving to me in the lobby. Guess I'll see what this is all about since the story won't move forward until I do.\n \n---------------------------\nNovember 21, 11:30 AM\nThe Pyropizm Corporation\nMain Floor Lobby\n---------------------------\n \nPhoenix: Did you want to see me?\n \nKhushrenada: Yes. Hello. My name is Khushrenada. I wanted to talk to you about what happened with Bill.\n \nPhoenix: What about?\n \nKhushrenada: Ian Sane. The police have arrested him but he didn't do it.\n \nPhoenix: How do you know about that?\n \nKhushrenada: It is all over the news. \n \nPhoenix: Oh. Well, what do you want from me?\n \nKhushrenada: I want you to represent him and defend him.\n \nPhoenix: Oh. I don't think so. The evidence seems clear. I looked myself and couldn't find anything unusual.\n \nKhushrenada: No. He is innocent. You must help him.\n \nPhoenix: How can you be so sure?\n \nKhushrenada: Because Ian Sane would never break the rules and killing a fellow member is definitely against the rules.\n \nPhoenix: Fellow member? Rules? What are you talking about?\n \nKhushrenada: I am not at liberty to say too much but myself, the victim, the suspect, the real killer and many others are all linked to one another through a secret organization.\n \nPhoenix: What is this organization?\n \nKhushrenada: I'm not going to give you all the answers right now. I just told you that. Meet me at this location tomorrow morning and I will tell you more then. In the meantime, please take the case. If anyone can find Ian Sane innocent, it is you Phoenix Wright. And now this, others are working to help you on this case. You will not fight alone.\n \n*Khushrenada runs away*\n \nPhoenix: Right. They always say that until the trial where I actually have to fight alone. Now I'm curious what this is all about. What should I do now? Take the case of course. Guess I'll go meet my client.\n \n-------------------------\nNovember 21, 3:45 PM\nDetention Center\nVisitation Room\n-------------------------\n \nIan Sane: Who are you?\n \nPhoenix: I'm Phoenix Wright. I've heard about your troubles today and against my better judgement, I've decided to offer my services to you.\n \nIan: What? No way! Awesome. I got the greatest defense lawyer in the whole world. Everyone knows you are an expert on pinning the blame on someone else. I'm going to be free in no time.\n \nPhoenix: W-W-W-WHAT!? No, it doesn't work like that. I don't pin blame...\n \nIan: Well, I'll see you tomorrow.\n \nPhoenix: Whoa! Wait! Come back. I need to talk to you about what happened.... today...... He left. *sigh* Why don't I keep my office locked? I could prevent a lot of this stuff before it even happened. Well, guess I'll see my client tomorrow. At least he'll have to stick around longer then.\n \nTo be continued.........."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.148474"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.148474"]]

There is no godfather. Instead, any one of the mafia members can send in the hit. This means that the mafia can work together and agree on a pick or someone can just say screw it, I'm doing it my way. The first member to send in a hit choice is the hit that will be chosen. Now let's say player 1 sends in a hit and later in the day player 2 sends in a hit. But then player 1 changes his hit to someone else. That will be considered a new hit and player 2's choice will then be the hit selection since player 1 has nullified his earlier hit choice. If anyone wants further clarification on this role, just ask, I'm happy to explain it further. Finally, if the player who sends in the hit is voted out that day, his hit will not go through but chances are the mafia will make just make sure someone else sends in the hit.\n \n \nThe Man of a Thousand Faces - Due to his amazing acting ability, this player is able to disguise himself and not be detected by any who might be trying to pursue him. Basically, this means that if investigated, the investigation will come back as proclaiming any role in the game the player chooses.\n \nThe Pony Killer - This role came about because Vudu wanted a pony. So, spoilers ahead. In The Godfather, a director will not bow to the Godfather's wishes and cast a person in a movie role. To make him an offer he can't refuse, the director's prized horse is killed and its head is put in the director's bed while he's sleeping. He wakes up the next day horrified and does what the mafia asks. What's that you say? It's not a spoiler, everyone knows that. Oh. Anyways, like the movie, this player can make another player \"an offer he can't refuse\" and change that player's vote. For story purposes, we'll say he does it by killing a person's pony and puts the head in an odd location.\n \nThe Drug Dealer - Can't handle the fame and pressure of being in the spotlight? Don't worry, your pal here has just what you need. The drug dealer can choose any player and offer them a free sample. If the player chooses to accept, he will soon find himself hooked and doing whatever the dealer asks to get his next fix. Basically, the dealer can try and recruit a player over to the mafia side. He will give me the name of a player he would like to send a gift package to. I'll pm that player with the offer. I'll let the dealer know the response. If the person accepts, he will learn the identity of the dealer at the beginning of the next game day and join the mafia side. If he refuses, the dealer is able to offer another player his \"gift\" the next day. If the dealer is killed, the player who was hooked will be taken out of the game for one day and put in rehab. Once out of rehab, the player has a choice he will pm me with. Will he go back to clean living and join the townies or will the experience have done nothing for him and he wishes to stay with his bad influence friends and stay mafia? Drugs. Just say no.\n \nTownie Roles\n \nThe Fan Favorite\n\nThis player can not be killed by the mafia only by public popularity. This player can only die by getting voted out of the game since that will be a sign of the public turning on him. With no fans to see his movies he will be washed up. Alternative title for this role: Ben Affleck. Haw haw.\n\nThe Producer\n\nThis is his production and you are going to have to do things his way. His vote can never be changed or influenced by another player. If the pony killer tries his crap on him, he'll hunt the pony killer down and kill him. This is a whammy for the The Pony Killer obviously.\n \nMotion Picture Production Code\n\nAlso known as the moral or Hayes Code. As the enforcer of this code, you have the power to change scenes and scripts in Hollywood to live up to your values. And if anyone should try to offer you drugs, they'll have committed career suicide. This is a whammy for the Drug Dealer.\n \n\n \nThe Point System\n\nYou may have noticed that I didn't list an investigator. For this game, I'm going to use a system a bit similiar to my warbucks idea from awhile back. In another suggestion I recieved, I was told I should make voting and posting everyday mandatory and try to eliminate to the non-participation strategy. I'd hoped my performance a few games ago would remind players that everyone is a threat not just the active players. That said, I've never begrudged anyone for using the non-active route and I'm not going to with this game. Sorry anonymous suggestor. That said, I've always believed in rewarding the active players and that is what I have here with this point system. \n \nHow does it work? \n \nIf you cast a vote, you get a point. That means when I lock the day thread, you have a vote in bold for another player. Self votes do not count. Voting during the day then cancelling it later does not count. It must be a vote that stands when the tally is counted. \n \nIf the player you voted for is the one voted out that day, you get another point. This might encourage bandwagons but for those who are smart, you'll try and keep the voting close to keep other players from getting that extra point.\n \nI will give out points for roleplay and game play posts. You can get 1 more point a day for this. That said, there is a limit on these points. I will only give out 3 points for roleplay posts and 3 for gameplay posts. The roleplay points might come under a bit of criticism since it's a bit of judgement call but I think one can usually see which are the best of the day. The roleplay points are handed out at the end of the day so you have all day for that. As for the gameplay awards, they are first come first serve. I'll be handing them out during the day as I monitor the daily threads. What makes for a gameplay post? A post where a person makes a sound arguement, right or wrong. Where some sort of sensible reasoning is posted. What doesn't count? An accusation with no basis given, a current vote tally, stating how many hours are left in the day, I know you are but what am I arguments. Now you can still make those posts. I just won't give you a bonus for them.\n \nFinally, every player is worth 11 points. When a player is voted out, that point total is divided evenly among the ones who voted him out. Whatever points are left over are carried over to the next day and added to the total for the next day's vote. \n \nIt should be worth noting that the mafia does not get the total points a player has when making a hit on them. They can only get the points the same way as everyone else. Voting and posting.\n \nWhat can I get with my points?\n\nAs soon as you have enough points for an item, you can cash them in or hold on to them and keep accumulating them for something else. Some items are limited, some are unlimited.\n \nHire the tabloids:2 points - Want to spread a rumor but don't want it coming back to you. Give an anonymous tip to the gossip columnists. Everyday, the tabloids will be posted along with the story. Maybe the rumors are true or maybe they aren't. You have to decide if you want to trust the rumors. Availabilty - unlimited.\n \nHire an investigator:4 points - Want to get the dirt on the other players? Hire an investigator and learn their role. Availabilty - unlimited.\n \nStar Power:4 points - Don't like another co-star? The director? The writer? Then try using your star power. With the star power ability, your vote will now be worth the power of 3 votes. Moreover, if successful voting a person out, your vote will count as 3 when the point total is handed out giving you around three times the points. Beware though. If the Pony Killer uses his power on you while you have star power, that will be 3 votes for his choosing. Availability: unlimited.\n \nHire a bodyguard:6 points - Don't feel safe? Getting some creepy fan mail? Hire a bodyguard who will always love you. If you should get voted out or have a mafia hit come your way, the bodyguard will take the bullet for you. One time use only and then you'll have to hire somebody new if there's still someone around to take the job. Availability: 2\n \nJoin the Acadamy:8 points - Want to play a role in preserving the legacy of you and your fellow actor's work? Then join the acadamy. With this prestigious role, you are able to put forth your voice on a few issues. There are three issues you will get to specially vote. Bring a player back from the dead (lifetime achievement award), take away a player's points (fined for not paying dues), and eliminate a player (banished from Hollywood). Note there are only three spots available for the acadamy. However, if a player dies, then a spot is opened up and someone else can claim it. Matters can only be vote on when there are 3 players in the acadamy. There must be a majority on the issues being voted on for them to pass. Availability: 3.\n \nMulti-million dollar deal:13 points - Play hard to get and have the studio show you the money. With this contract, you have unlimited access to spread any tabloid rumors you want, you will be given one star power which you can use at anytime, and if a townie, you will randomly be given the names of two townies whom you can trust. If mafia, you get two free investigations. Availability: 1.\n \nNote: Unless otherwise stated, all bonus abilities must be used the day they are purchased or they expire and you waste the points for nothing."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.162850"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.162850"]]

Is it Mario, with his fame? Is it Yoshi, with his cuteness? Is it Donkey Kong, with his strength? Is it Wario, with his wit? Is it Luigi, with his, uh... hat? After a heated argument breaks out amongst Mario and his friends, Peach decides to host a grand party filled with fun and games at the castle to determine who has the qualities of a real Superstar. Catching word of this event, Bowser paces back and forth, plotting a way to ruin this party, since he was not invited. Will the good times roll at the castle, or will Bowser and his cronies crash the party?\n\nGeneral\nThis game has no special roles, not even the Godfather. Instead, every ability is granted randomly each day, determined by a role of the die. This gives each and every player a chance to use a special power, but also adds an element of unpredictability. You never know who will end up with what, so anything can happen!\n\nAll actions happen overnight. An action can be sent in at any time during the day, and must be received before thirty minutes after the daily thread closes. Actions are not time-sensitive; some take priority over others. If an ability is not used by the end of the day, it does not carry over to the next day.\n\nThe Townies\nThere are no townie roles. Every ability which is usually associated with a townie role is now a random ability which will be assigned to each player every day, that will change every day.\n\nTownie rolls\n1: Red Space   \nThe player's vote for that day will not be counted in the tally. They may still cast a vote in the thread, it will just not count.\n2: Ballot Box Space\nThe player can change the vote of another player.\n3: Protection Space\nThe player will be protected from the nightly hit.\n4: Investigator Space\nThe player may investigate another player and learn their role.\n5: Blue Space\nThe player's vote for that day will count as two votes.\n6: Bob-omb Space\nThe player transforms into a bomb! If they are hit that night, then the Mafia member who performed the hit will lose along with the player. If the bomb player is voted out, the player who cast the first vote against the bomb player will be taken out as well.\n\nThe Mafia\nThe number of Mafia members will depend on the number of people who sign up. If we get the typical number of signups as we have these past few games, then there will probably be 4 Mafia.\n\nThere is no Godfather role. Instead, one member of the Mafia will be randomly selected each day to perform the nightly hit. All members will be informed who currently has this ability. If the member with the power is voted out that day, the hit will be stopped.\n\nMafia rolls:\n1 or 4: Feign Innocence Space\nIf this player is investigated on this day, they will come back as a townie.\n2 or 5: Nullify Space\nThe player can choose another player to nullify their ability, causing whatever it may be to be ineffective.\n3 or 6: Starman Space -or- 3: Red Space, 6: Blue Space\nThese numbers are situational. If the player with the hit power gets this, it will guarantee the nightly hit will be successful, regardless of any protection the target may have. Also grants protection from being exploded by a bomb player. If a player doesn't have the hit, they will receive the effects of the coloured space corresponding to the number rolled.\n\nMinigame and Reward\nEach day, there will be a minigame which all players can participate in. What kind of minigame will appear? Nobody knows! The player(s) who win a minigame will be rewarded with one free roll, to be used at any time. This item allows the player to receive a different roll for the current day."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.168744"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.168744"]]

No one would seriously ever want to do that) and do it in bold. Votes not appearing like that will not count. You only get 1 vote a day. If you wish to change your vote, modify your original message to just say unvote Khushrenada and undo the bold and then post a new vote either in that same post or in a new one.

NOTE: As an added bonus, the Day's Executioner can not be killed by the mafia that night. A little extra bonus to play for. \n \nVoting Deadlines\n\nDays will end usually at midnight EST. If I'm a bit late and the thread stays open for a bit longer, any action taken is still legal even if past the midnight time. Until the thread is locked, the game is on.

If a tie is not resolved by the end of the 30 minutes, then no executioner is elected and noone is safe from the mafia hit that night.\n \nTownie and Mafia Hits\n\nThe Public Executioner and the Mafia have 30 minutes after the end of the day's vote to send in their hits. If the godfather is hit by the public executioner, the mafia still gets to make their hit. \n \nVoting Requirement!!!\n\nThere is a voting requirement of at least once every two days. If a player has not cast a vote after two days of gameplay, they are eliminated and must bear the shame of letting down their team and being a big failure."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.178536"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.178536"]]

Can message me with a name and I will inform them that person who Cyborg is.Kinda risky that last one but it might help get the townies hooked up quicker.\n\n Villians Roles\n\nThis game Slade will get to pick his own team from the avalable roles below.Darkfire will be on the team already.\n\nSlade: Can choose who to kill by sending me a PM of who. He can either choose himself to make the hits or can choose one of his Mafia members to do the hit.He will show up as townie in searches.Once day 4 has rolled around he will chose the investigators searches. \n\nDarkfire: She is the only one that can kill Starfire when chosen to do so.She will show up as a townie in searches.Has the Mafia pretender role.\n\nThe Apprentice: Can investigate one person a night. Avalable to Mafia at the start of the 4th day.Show up as Apprentice. He will also not know who the Mafia are until he is perminately a Mafia member by Starfires death.This is to prevent him from going back to being a townie and spilling the roles.His role will be controlled by Slade till he becomes a perminate role. If for some reason Slade doesn't send in a search then the apprentices search will be used.\n\nCinderblock: Will be able to protect Slade one time if Slade is attacked.He will die after that.Will show up as Cinderblock in searches.\n\nMad Mod:Will be able to nullify one persons ability a night.Will show up as Mad Mod in searches.\n\nPuppet King: Will be able to switch 2 persons roles. He can not switch townies and Mafia members roles but can switch 2 Mafia members roles or he can switch 2 townie roles.Will show up as Puppet King in searches.\n \nPlasmus: Can pretend to show up as anyone in the game for a day in searches.Meaning their roles. However he will morph back to his regular role the next day. If the person with the role doesn't choose to use their ability the first day then it show up as Plasmus until they choose to use thieir role.\n\nIf Slade dies then there will be a vote for a new leader and there won't be a hit that night.If someone is chosen as the hit for the night by Slade they won't be able to use their own abilities that night aside from Darkfire.\n The majority of the roles will be either one a night but not both a night for everybody.\n\n\nI think that is it.If anybody sees something you want add just mention it in the thread.

In the meantime, I figured we might as well get the ball rolling on sign-ups.\n \nTo all those who sign up, Kirby says Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.\n \nRoles/Rules\n \nAlright. So, if you were afraid I was going to do something like Public Executioners where we voted an executioner, I'm not. It will be the regular style of voting for whom you think is guilty.\n \nThere is only one mafia. Here it is:\n \nDark Matter Mafia\n \nDark Matter - The Force of Evil. The godfather of the Mafia. Because he can infect anyone, Dark Matter can not be identified by investigation. It's powerful eye-beam allows it to damage of 3 points to a player.\n \nKing Dedede - The Greedy Pengiun. His Hammer attack is worth 2 damage points. King Dedede also has a very powerful set of lungs and can suck in abilities. But he can not use them and will just digest them and thus remove that power for the rest of the game.\n \nMeta Knight - The Dark Kirby. No one knows the true story of Meta Knight but he once built a really wicked flying battleship to take over Dreamland and turned himself into legend. His sword ability is masterful and damage from it will cause 3 damage points to any player. His attack can also stun a player and prevent them from using an ability that day.\n \nWaddle Dee/Waddle Doo - The Cannon Fodder. As long as Dark Matter controls the mafia, Waddle Dee will be Waddle Doo. With his eye-beam, he can do 2 damage. If Dark Matter is eliminated, he goes back to being Waddle Dee and can do 1 damage by running into players. Clumsy oaf! However, because Waddle Dee is considered a weakling, nobody bothers to hide their hit points from him. Waddle Dee can see any players hit points and get continuous updates as long as they live.\n \nThe Killer\n \nMARX! - The master strategist? I hope we have enough players for this game. Marx, the genius, is once again posing as a harmless Dream Land resident. He has helped start this battle between Kirby and the Dark Matter Mafia. And while they are warring, he intends to slyly gain great power for himself. Marx can eliminate any player of his choosing. He will also gain that players ability which he can then use for the rest of the game until he is stopped.\n \nTownies\n \nKirby - Ability master. For the role of Kirby, something a little special will be done. Kirby will have a wall of options to choose from. Everyday, he can choose from that wall one choice which will reveal an item or ability. Kirby then has to decide if he wants to keep his current ability or swap for the new one. Whatever he doesn't choose will then be lost and unable to be chosen later.\n \nGooey - One of the choices in the Kirby wall of ability is Gooey. If that is selected, one townie will at random be chosen as Gooey. Kirby and Gooey will then know who each other is and can partner together.\n \nCitizens of Dreamland - These are regular townies and can vote each day.

Out of the orb came the voice of King Zaden III:\n\n\n\"I would welcome you all here, but the circumstances under which we gather are the worst I could have ever imagined. Among you, there are people who would seek to not only undermine my rule, but harm the citizens of Leoria. It is up to us to weed out this evil and protect our kingdom.\"\n\n\nMurmurs of assent followed the king's statement, but the orb was not yet done:\n\n\n\"You have all been given names and appearances that will hide who you are, and in doing so, I hope that people's true intentions will be seen without the bias of history blinding the righteous. There are eight council members, myself, and two members of the Regal Guard who will take up the voting that will determine who is executed each night. You must all remain diligent, and sagacious. Trusting, but discerning. Unrelenting, but forgiving. As your king, I want this land to prosper, and its people to be happy. I fear that if we do not stop the usurpers, all hope for our people will be lost. We must fight, and we must win. Council be true!!\"\n\n\nSilenced followed the orb's evaporation, as those paying attention realized that there were thirteen people with their faces disfigured and wearing the blue robes that were supposed to signify them as members of the royal council; according to the king's orb, there should only have been eleven. \n\n\nAfter a few moments, it was the head chef who whispered loudly; \n\"There are two who do not belong, and making it worse, their addition makes the council number thirteen: the forbidden number.\"\n\n\nMore whispers followed this statement, but the council members feared to say anything, lest in being the first to speak, they put either a target on themselves for the usurpers or cast doubt on themselves for the pending vote. \n\n\nThe castle's servants, no longer feeling the magical pull that led them to the council room, began leaving slowly, milling around, trying to consolidate rumors and combine theories, before returning to their duties.\n\n\nWhen it was just the 13 supposed council members staring at each other nervously as a cold wind blew around the hems their robes, the Regal Guard entered the throne room and motioned for them to all be seated. \n\n\nWithout warning, a deep voice resounded from somewhere in the middle of the gathered guards:\n\"We were expecting there to be twelve of you, the council, the king, the guard members, and the demon. But we also know that the killer known as Rogue escaped the dungeons and was trapped here by our magic.\"\n\n\n\"You were expecting the demon?\" A voice called out. Luckily, all eyes were on the Regal Guard and the shouter went unnoticed and managed not to blush as everyone searched for the culprit.\n\n\n\"The demon and his conjurers wish to take over the kingdom, what better way to do that than systematically remove the governing body of Leoria? They will still have to face the Regal Guard, but without the king, our power will be lessened. If King Zaden and Knight Jamisson die there is little hope for Leoria, if all the council dies, there is none. Remember this as you vote. Do not do so carelessly and without reason. There are nearly a million lives resting on each vote you cast. Take not this task lightly. You have been warned.\"\n\n\nMore silence.\n\n\n\"You may begin your deliberations, council\"\n\n\nWith that, the Regal Guard filed out the room, and the doors closed ominously behind them, leaving the council, and the usurpers looking 'round the room and each other, wondering who would be the first to  speak."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.196047"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.196047"]]

I may change this though \n\n\n\nItems\n\nAnybody can use items. Good or bad.\n\nElements of Harmony\n\nThe Elements of Harmony can be used by someone who finds them but there is a catch. They have to figure out who is the Mane 6 and PM me their guess. They only get one guess a day. If they are correct then they can use it if they wish to use it on 1 person who they think is Mafia. If the Mafia gets the item then they can't use it but they will keep it away from the townies/Mane 6 and if the person with the EoH dies then that becomes unusable to the Mane 6 because it has been corrupted by Darkness. If the person with the EoH dies and is on the townie side then it goes back in the item pile. \n\nInvisible Ink. This is more of a defensive item. You can be invincible for 2 attacks during the night.\n\nPoison Joke Flower. This item causes the holder to not be able to do their action for the day. Be it Role or night action. You have no control over this really till the next day is up. This also affect the Mafias hit if the person in charge of the hit gets it.\n\nUmbrella Hat: Your Pinkie Sense is twitching. Basically you can tell what type of role is being used on you when you have this item but not who is using it on you. Kinda a reverse investigation. You have to figure out who is looking for you yourself.\n\nAnvil:This is one of the attacking items. I am either going to just make it so that it can stun the person for the day. This is different then Poison Joke Flower in that it only affects their role.\n\nBinoculars: This item can tell you the persons role. \n\nKnock out gas: This basically causes the person it is used on to not be able to vote for the next day. \n\nKatana Sword: This item kills one person and then it goes back in the pile. \n \nChocolate Rain: Eternal Chaos comes with Chocolate Rain you guys Chocolate Rain! Basically a lot of bad things happen for both sides. This is an envirmental item and will last for 2 days after it has been unleashed. It basically causes lots of random stuff to happen to the items and roles and the Mafia. Pretty much the vote is the only safe measure unless you are really gambling with things. \n\nMare do Well Mask. This Mask can give the bearer the ability to fly above attacks or defend. The flying has a limited amount of uses. The flying, however will not reset back to the max when it goes back in the pile. The defends have an unlimited amount of uses. Basically you need to vote out this person to get this person out for good whoever is holding it at the time. Can defend against hits by Mafia for townies and can fly over items for the Mafia.\n\nBuzz Saw. This item can kill someone of the players choosing. Simple as that. \n\nFinally the Power of Love Spell. This can be used to either get rid of the Chocolate rain sooner if it is active or to get past Queen Chrystalis blockade of investigations quicker and find out who she is. For the Mafia they can use it and if Queen Chrystalis gets it as a item then she can add a member to the team because Queen Chrystalis feeds on love.\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of the game?\n\nIf you are on the townie side you want to vote out the Mafia.\n\nIf you are Mafia you want to vote out the townie side."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.201766"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.201766"]]

So no action will cancel another action.\nDay Actions:  Actions marked as 'Day Action' occur while the thread is open and their effects occur immediately when the Host confirms the action.\n\n Voting:The player with the most votes at the end of the day (adding in any special power affects on those votes) is eliminated from the game and their true role is revealed. In the event of a tie all players involved in the tie will die. Players will type out the players name they wish to vote to kill and bold the name. If they change their mind later, they should go back and unbold and strikethrough the old vote and then post the new vote. Example: (Old Post) Vote Mop it up; (New Post) Vote Khushrenada\nDeath: If you are voted out or killed by a player action you cannot post in any current or new Day Threads and are removed from play in the game. You may not talk about specifics of the game or what you knew until the game is over. You may post general frustration in the Dead Thread which will be created for you to badger and egg on other players or vent your frustrations at your new ethereal state.\n\nFestive Party Crowd (Townie) Roles\nSanta Clause (Benefactor)- This is a new role (as far as I know). Santa and his 'Little Helpers' are seeking to stop the mafia from carrying out their heinous plot while also spreading joy to the world. Santa gets to 'give out' two of the roles on his list each day to different players. Roles to be given out include: Doctor, Vigilante and Investigator. If Santa is killed, his helper then takes over as the next Santa. This new Santa is allowed to select another 'helper' (Role rules for Santa's Little Helper still apply). Gift giving is considered a Day Action. Gifts given after Thread Lock are not issued until the next day and will count towards the new day's gift total. To give a gift, Santa will send a PM to the Host with the name of the player and what gift they shall receive and the Host will notify the player. Santa may give out no more than two different gifts a day. (No multiple doctor toys running around for example). He may give out one or even no gifts if he deems everyone to be on the naughty list.\n\nSanta’s Little Helper (Benefactor’s Apprentice)– Santa chooses a person to be his ‘helper’. This person is not notified by the Host until Santa’s passing that he is the next Santa. The player is free to inform the helper themselves but there is no certainty on the helper's part that this is truth unless the Host is the one telling them this.\n \n \nBoozer (Investigator)- This will be a participation awarded role. The person with the highest number of VALID posts is awarded the power of investigation that night. Multiple posts in a row are not counted. You must wait for someone else to post before you can post again. Post edits do not count. To prevent abuse or attempted abuse someone who repeatedly multiposts and receives three warnings in a day will succumb to alcohol poisoning and pass out. Passed out players will not be able to perform their role or have their vote count for the rest of the day and night. Either a townie or a mafia player can win this role (even if they already have a separate designated role) so this can be a powerful tool for both sides. Repeated offenses in a row may result in a harsher punishment. If it must escalate to this point then the Host will make an announcement in the beginning of a day thread listing out the extended consequences of repeated abuse so there will be no surprise judgments against anyone. \n \nGifted Roles\nAll gifted roles are night actions.\nDoctor Kit (Doctor)- the doctor can select one person to protect throughout the night. This will make them immune to any action that would kill them. Doctor Kit cannot protect someone from being voted \nSuper Solver Seekers Kit (Investigator) - This allows the player to \n.22 (Vigilante) -  The vigilante wants to be a good guy, but taking the law into your own hands can be dangerous. Vigilante can sent in a hit at night to kill a player if they choose to. The catch is that if the target player turns out to be a townie then the vigilante will also die. ***Important- If the role if given to a mafia player, the role changes. The mafia vigilante must hit either Santa or his Helper or else they die as well.\n\n Vengeful Wife and Her Friends (Mafia) Roles\n \n \nVengeful Wife (Godfather) - She is out to get her party-going husband and all of his friends. She puts in the hit every night tokill off one of the party goers. Investigations against her show a regular townie. Getting removed from play leads to The Other Friend becoming the Godfather. If both Godfather and the Goon are killed then the remaining mafia must decide who will be the new godfather. No one after the original Vengeful Wife will be hidden from an investigation. Night Action\n \n Seductress (vote changer)– This is one of the wife’s friends who can choose one player to seduce and change their vote in the final tally. Day Action\n \n The Sharer (role nullifier)– This is one of the wife’s friends who can get another player so drunk that they cannot use their power that night. If they have no power then nothing happens.

I haven't decided times for ending and beginning days.  Being in Korea, I need to think about the best situation, since my days are strange.  The more people sign up the more Monster mayhem I can do.  So please join and lets kick of 2014 giant monster style.\n\nMafia:  The Monsters.  I haven't decided which monsters will be featured, but I do know they will have special abilities.  The special abilities will work like this.  The mafia can choose to either kill someone or use a monsters special ability.  To use the special ability THAT monster with the ability must PM the action to me.  No two special abilities can be performed two days in a row.  However killing is not considered a special ability so the mafia can always kill instead of using a monster's ability, and can kill every day.It is important to communicate as mafia and plan your actions, because if I get a special ability PM, I will do that as the overriding action even if a hit is put in.  (Obviously, if you contact me before the time limit is up, then I can cancel actions and do the actions the mafia desire.)\n\nSpecial Abilities include: \nCounter Attack:  Counter Attacks, prevent the targeted player from using their ability the next day.  It has a delayed result.  So if you use it on Day 1 night action.  The Day 2 action is canceled for the targeted player.  Freeze Attack:  This ability can cancels 2 players votes.  This does not change their vote, but prevents them from voting.  This action does not have a delayed effect, and can be used to change the results of the vote for that day.\nOptic Camouflage:  This ability can hide the identity of all mafia members for the next day.  It has a delayed result.  When Camouflage is activated, It will be posted the monsters are in hiding.  The investigator role will not be able to use their action this turn.  If they do they will get no information back townie or otherwise.   Monsters can still be voted out and killed by Godzilla or a Vigilante if the game has one.  \n\nGodzilla is the killer role. His motivation is to stop the invading monsters, and to protect the fairy twins.  Therefore, Godzilla can win the game if all monsters are killed and the fairy twins are still alive.  If the fairy twins die Godzilla must win by killing everyone…and his anger will give him boosted abilities.  Godzilla acts just like the mafia.  He has special abilities and hits.  Godzilla can choose to kill a player, but if he randomly kills the fairy twins he loses his special ability for the game.  \nSpecial abilities include:  \n1) Energy Absorption.  Godzilla can save energy to do an extra kill the next day.  Energy absorption is a delayed effect.  So night one, Godzilla absorbs energy.  Night 2, he can kill 2 people.  This ability can be stacked multiple times.  \n2) If the twin fairies are killed then Godzilla gains an ability: Revenge.  He gains the ability to perform a second hit the next day, IF he either kills a monster or the player that killed the twin fairies.  If the fairies are killed by the vote there is no bonus against the player whom killed the twins.  This is a delayed ability.  So for example.  The fairies are dead and Godzilla attacks the monsters day 2 and kills one.  Day 3 he has two attacks he can perform.  These can be stacked just like the charge attacks.  However, Godzilla can only get one bonus a day.  So if Day 3 he kills 2 Monsters, he will not get 3 attacks Day 4, but only 2 attacks.  \n\n-Baby Zilla:  If we have enough players.  I will add in this special role. Baby Zilla is a marked townie, that will become Godzilla after Godzilla dies.  Unless Godzilla is the last monster killed, in which a townie victory is declared.  The idea of this role is to give Godzilla the ability to effect the game more.  The original may die.  However, a new player hidden in the townies will rise up.  If Baby Zilla is investigated while in townie mode…he will appear to be a townie.  However, if he takes the role of Godzilla he is investigated as Godzilla.  Baby Zilla does not have any special abilities and therefore will only act as the normal killer role.  \n\nTownie Roles:\n\nFairy Twins:  Townies that know each other.  If we have enough players to make a fair team for the townies, then if one of the fairies die, they both die together.  \n\nScientists:  The Scientists can investigate a player to find their role.  Or they can try to heal a player.  They can heal monster attacks, or can perform a special heal to protect against the vote out, but  lose the ability to do an action the next day.\n\nEDF:  They are the Vigilante.  If they kill a townie or the scientists they will die, but they can kill the mafia, Godzilla, or the fairy twins with no penalty.  Instead of attacking the EDF can Perform a special action and change the vote of a player to a different player.  Those are my basic ideas for abilities.  I think the game should be balanced with a fairly interesting play mechanic devised on teams choosing abilities to use.  Anyway, please sign up if you are interested in playing.\n\nSpecial rule for ties.  I will only kill the characters in a tie.  So remember townies if you want to win you better have decisive votes because there are special powers that can create ties.  Also EDF, you will be a protector for the townies to prevent ties or cause them to trap mafia members.

However, unlike the other 2 times this theme has come up, I've finally played an Animal Crossing game and so now I'm even more enthused about using it. It just works so well.\n\nThe Misadventures of Shangri-La\n\nPrologue\n\n\nI was travelling the rails in search of a new destination after my life fell apart. I hadn't left my house in 9 months because day to day existence had got it's gentle grip on me and was suffocating my soul. When I finally decided to face the world again, I found it had gone to hell. There were weeds everywhere, flies and cochroaches infesting everything and all the cool neighbors and friends I had known had moved, replaced with some weird freaks that I wanted no business with.\n\n \n\n\nFish-Duck here still haunts my mind.\n\nClearly, it was time to make a change in life. Maybe if I started over in a new spot, I'd find the zest for life I used to have when I was friends with all my neighbors and a contributing member of the community. And that is why I hopped on the rails in search of a new destination that sounded right for me. Unfortunately, I was soon accosted by some creepy cat trying to find out all kinds of personal and private information about me. \n\n\nIf one of the first things you have to say to somebody is that you are not crazy, it is because you are. \n \nSince I did mind him sitting with me, I immediately got off at the first stop which was some place called Shangri-La. No sooner do I exit the train station when I'm suddenly confronted by a group of people welcoming me to the town. I checked myself over to make sure I wasn't carrying any drugs in case that was causing all these animals to be attracted to me where ever I went but I was surprisingly clean on that front. Maybe I had already used them because one of the animals from the welcoming committee started telling everyone I was the new mayor and I was taken straight away to City Hall to begin my reign. Now, normally, I might have objected but, as it turns out, my being mayor of the town has always been the host's role in this game so the whole thing kind of works out great storywise.\n\nDespite things seeming to be pretty rosy at first, I soon found out Shangri-La was pretty troubled. First, I found out that the whole real estate market was cornered by one Tom Nook and he was dictating where houses could and couldn't be built and charging whatever he wanted for home sales and renovations. Then when I went shopping, I discovered that a couple of his relatives Timmy and Tommy had basically taken control of the sale of nearly all merchandise for the city and all citizens were at the mercy of whatever they chose to stock and had to buy it at whatever price they chose to sell. \n\nI wasn't going to stand for an iron grip on the marketplace so I went to find the local sheriff to see about busting up this cartel. That's when I discovered there was no police station in town. Apparently, it's something that has to be requested by the citizens and then money has to be raised to build it and hire a detective. Thus, I gathered the citizens and explained the situation to them. It wasn't easy. They wanted me to pick fruit for them and deliver packages for them and fish for them but I finally was able to win them over and agree to get a police station started. \n\nIt felt so good. Once again, I had a purpose in life beyond just picking weeds and buying a new piece of clothing. I was going to help these people to cast off the oppresive economic sanctions being levelled against them by the corrupt Nook empire and lead them to a better life of freedom with plenty of bells for all. Of course, things can look great in theory but when applied to the real world, well, then you can encounter some bumps along the way as I was about to discover........"], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.216338"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.216338"]]

With the help of the Doctor, a time traveler who showed up on the same day, they were able to learn that George Ratcliffe was working with a race of creatures known as the Daleks. It appears that there are not one, but two opposing Dalek factions who both seek control of a device known as the Hand of Omega which the Doctor claims to have stashed somewhere in town a while back. However The Doctor believes that the ICMG has been infiltrated by both Dalek factions.\n\n\nGroup Captain Gilmore (cop): leader of the ICMG (Intrusion Countermeasures Group) he can use his sources in the British intelligence agency to investigate other players and find out their roles. I will allow a day 0 investigation.\n\n\nThe Doctor (Role blocker): Is aware of everything that happens at night and can prevent any night actions from happening. This ability can only be used Twice.\n\n\nDr. Rachel Jensen: (Doctor) Captain Gilmore's scientific advisor and medical personnel. Has the ability to protect someone but not herself\n\n\nDorothy \"Ace\" Mcshane: (Vigilante): instead of cowering in fear and screaming like his previous companions the Doctors current companion goes after daleks with baseball bats and her own specialized homemade explosive.\n\n\nMike Smith (Miller): a young man formerly employed to George Ratcliffe. Although he is functionally a normal townie should he be investigated Captain Gilmore will be told he is a Dalek.\n\nThe Mafias:\nImperial Daleks:\n\nDavros (godfather): leader of the Imperial Daleks, registers as townie when investigated. \n\n\nSpecial Weapons Dalek(role cop): A special forces Dalek who's advanced targeting systems can be used to investigate a player and learn of their roles. This ability can only be used twice. Dalek supreme and Captain Gilmore are unaffected.\n\nImperial Dalek drone:\n\nIt's a regular dalek, what else is there to say. It shoots lasers and serves Davros. (Will be put into play when we reach 13 players along with its renegade counterpart)\n\nRenegade Daleks\n\nDalek Supreme(godfather 2): Leader of the renegade Daleks. Registers as townie when investigated.\n\n\nLittle girl/battle computer(role cop): The Dalek Battle computer leeches off the mind of a little girl and her capacity for imagination. Because of this the little girl can be controlled by the computer by remote and used to investigate for player roles with the exception of Davros and Captain Gilmore. This ability can only be used twice.\n\n\nRenegade Dalek drone: I think of the two, this is the one you shake to get pepper. Oh nope, it's shooting lasers at me. I think it's loyal to the renegade daleks but unless we reach 13 players we really won't know for sure.\n\nTie rule: God so help you if there's a tie. I may just do nothing, I may kill everyone who voted for a tie, I may pick some people and apply the 'voteless' or 'suicidal' role to them, it's like landing on a bowser space in mario party, except no sympathy for fourth place. \n\nbut the fun doesn't stop there, I may stop noting if for example a mafia member is killed to increase the suspense or start lying to the investigative roles, I may  kill anyone that Rachel tries to save. I may also kill anyone who sends me a kill request, who knows. \n\nBasically don't force a tie, or I start trolling the entire game\n\nBecause there is no killer starting on day 5 both dalek factions will be able to make a hit.

However if both the godfather and his underling request a kill then the Godfather's kill request will be granted,\n\nNight actions for all roles are due 20 minutes after the Days end.

With the help of the Doctor, a time traveler who showed up on the same day, they were able to learn that George Ratcliffe was working with a race of creatures known as the Daleks. It appears that there are not one, but two opposing Dalek factions who both seek control of a device known as the Hand of Omega which the Doctor claims to have stashed somewhere in town a while back. However The Doctor believes that the ICMG has been infiltrated by both Dalek factions.\n\n\nGroup Captain Gilmore (cop): leader of the ICMG (Intrusion Countermeasures Group) he can use his sources in the British intelligence agency to investigate other players and find out their roles. Group Captain Gilmore has two day 1 investigations, use them wisely captain.\n\n\nThe Doctor (Role blocker): Is aware of everything that happens at night and can prevent any night actions from happening. This ability can only be used Twice. He also has the ability to, at any time regenerate.\n\nRegeneration Should the Doctor opt to regenerate he will lose any of his additional night actions and his ability to vote but will still be able to guide the townies from beyond the grave. If it is done during the day then any votes made against him will be canceled.\n\n\nDr. Rachel Jensen: (Doctor) Captain Gilmore's scientific advisor and medical personnel. Has the ability to protect someone but not herself.\n\n\nDorothy \"Ace\" Mcshane: (Vigilante): instead of cowering in fear and screaming like his previous companions the Doctors current companion goes after daleks with baseball bats and her own specialized homemade explosive compound.\n\n\nMike Smith (Miller): a young man formerly employed to George Ratcliffe. Although he is functionally a normal townie should he be investigated Captain Gilmore will be told he is a Dalek. The Dalek investigators will merely be told that he's a townie.\n\nimportant, the player given the Mike Smith role will not be aware of his role. Thus anyone given the role 'townie' could potentially be Mike Smith\n\nThe Mafias:\nImperial Daleks:\n\nDavros (godfather): leader of the Imperial Daleks, registers as townie when investigated. \n\n\nSpecial Weapons Dalek(role cop): A special forces Dalek who's advanced targeting systems can be used to investigate a player and learn of their roles. This ability can be used twice for a night action on day 1 with a third additional use under the wing for future use. Dalek supreme, and Captain Gilmore are unaffected.\n\nImperial Dalek drone:\n\nIt's a regular dalek, what else is there to say. It shoots lasers and serves Davros. (Will be put into play when we reach 12 players along with its renegade counterpart)\n\nRenegade Daleks\n\nDalek Supreme(godfather 2): Leader of the renegade Daleks. Registers as townie when investigated.\n\n\nLittle girl/battle computer(role cop): The Dalek Battle computer leeches off the mind of a little girl and her capacity for imagination. Because of this the little girl can be controlled by the computer by remote and used to investigate for player roles with the exception of Davros and Captain Gilmore. This ability can be used twice for a night action on day 1 with a third additional use under the wing.\n\n\nRenegade Dalek drone: I think of the two, this is the one you shake to get pepper. Oh nope, it's shooting lasers at me. \n\nTie rule: God so help you if there's a tie. I may just do nothing, I may kill everyone who voted for a tie, I may pick some people and apply the 'voteless' or 'suicidal' role to them, it's like landing on a bowser space in mario party, except no sympathy for fourth place.\n\nLast time as you may recall I basically killed off an entire Dalek faction. I plan to be a bit more careful about how that sort of thing pans out this time if I decide to go that route.\n\nAnother idea I have is to send a few PMs kindly informing those who recieve them that I'm going to kill them in a day or two. I think it's a really Osgood way to kill someone off, wouldn't you agree? But don't tell anyone... we'll call it, \"our secret girl thing.\"\n\nOf course I could always do a few public investigations and let you respond accordingly, maybe lie about the results for one of them, It's a bit psychological really.\n\nOr I may just do nothing, as in not even having the two people who the town decided to vote against killed. That's always fun. Especially if I make it so neither of those people \n\nBecause there is no killer starting on day 4 both dalek factions will be able to make a hit. Day 2 will only allow the renegade Daleks to make a hit while Day 3 will only allow the imperial Daleks to make a hit. Neither faction will be given a kill on the first day which could be interesting.\n\nSilenced Godfather Clause: if the godfather cannot preform his duties for whatever reason one of his underlings may request a night kill in his place. However if both the godfather and his underling request a kill then the Godfather's kill request will be granted. On day one the two investigations by the Little Girl and Special Weapons Dalek can also be redeemed by this method.\nNight actions for all roles are due 20 minutes after the Days end. The Doctor will then be sent a list of night actions and asked if he wishes to block any of them (again this can be done twice), if you have a night action just PM me telling me who you want to investigate/kill/save."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.227302"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.227302"]]

Some are reasonably sized and could be climbed with ease. Others are gigantic cliffs that spell certain death to anyone daring enough to scale them.\n\nInside of these mountains, within an intricate network of caves, a colony of miners reside. They harvest grafituum—a metallic-like substance that can be melted to make energy—from the depths of the frozen landscape. The life of many a citizen runs on grafituum products. This particular miner group, Apex Mining, is the leading manufacturer.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarown has recently fallen on terrible times, and an economic downturn is slaughtering the labor force. Unemployment is increasing rapidly, and wages aren’t substantial to help life, partly due to an alarming inflation rise. To avoid the crisis, many companies have been looking to the mountains to try and weasel their way into the grafituum business, hoping to give jobs to workers and save the dwindling economy.\n\nApex, however, isn’t hearing a word of it. After hundreds of years in the trade, they have monopolized the occupation, and they refuse to lose their grip on it, fearful of becoming victimized by new competition.\n\nThe government of Sarown is too weak to make a decisive response. The outcries of multiple corporations at the unfair tactics of Apex fail to be taken into proper account. It seems as though there is no other option but to take matters into one’s own hands.\n\nFairman Products, a manufacturer of oil, which years ago was outclassed by grafituum, holds a particularly strong grudge against Apex. Wanting to reclaim their spot as top dogs in the energy industry, they begin to devise plans to sabotage Apex mines and to force the company to evacuate. Using stealth technology and key information of the company’s mines, Fairman employees begin to enter workplaces, setting up bombs or ruining electrical equipment and causing breakdowns.\n\nTheodore Apex, the stubborn president of his self-titled grafituum enterprise, sees these “failures” for what they are: attempted disruption attempts against the syndicate. Not willing to back down from a fight, Theodore vows that Apex will continue to control the business, beating out all that are brave enough to wander into the fray.\n\nA quiet war quickly begins. Fairman shoots first, sending in a clan of mercenaries in order to knock a particular Apex mine out-of-business. It’s a violent struggle between two heavyweights—one reluctant to relinquish his title, the other wanting his back.\n\nLet the games begin!!!\nGeneral Info:\nThis game will have a closed setup: the roles will be UNKNOWN except to the people that have them.\nBeing a closed setup game, this is not necessarily for the new players, but the game will be open to players of all skill levels.\nIt may be fun, but it IS serious: sign-up if you know you’ll be an active player.\nHave fun, most important part!.\nAbout voting:\nTo vote, use the format of vote username. Yes, it must be bolded. Preferably, put this at the end of your post.\n\nWhenever you want to No-Lynch, Abstain, or Unvote, the same formula goes.\n\nFor a vote to go through, a majority of the players must have voted on the same subject. When this occurs, everyone stops talking while the host wraps up the day events and prepares for the night portion of the game.\n\nRoles:\n\nTo use a role: To use any role given in this game, the only way to use your ability is to PM the host. So if your ability gives you the power to kill someone at night, you have to PM the host saying who you want to kill during nighttime hours. For day abilities, send a PM during day hours saying what you shall do with your ability.\n\nTown (x8 players, 3 power roles):\nCop - investigates a person each night\nDoctor - protects a person each night\nManager - has double vote power for two days (activated by sending a PM to the host)\nWorker - normal townie role\n\nMafia (x3 players, 2 power roles):Godfather - sends in hit, immune to investigation\nBodyguard - can protect the Godfather one night (activated by sending a PM to the host), takes over hit duties if Godfather dies and loses his ability\nInsurgent - normal mafia role, takes over hit duties if Godfather and Bodyguard are dead\n\nThird Party (x1 player, 1 power role):Timebomb - can set a bomb during the night (can only do this twice); he/she PMs the host with a target and a number ranging from 1 to 10 (this being the number of times the bomb can be passed), and during the day the target will be alerted they have the bomb and they must pass it on; when the amount of passes specified in the PM has been reached, the latest recipient of the bomb will die\n\n\nWin Conditions:\n\nWin Conditions will be stated in the role PMs given out before the game begins.\nThe roles present will be determined by how many people sign up. If not many people sign up the game will stay closed, but with fewer roles."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.230185"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:02:25.230185"]]

While the animals of the world take a moment to mourn his passing and remember the many things King Vudu was able to accomplish, many of them will also be pondering over what this means for the future of the Animal Kingdom and who will become the new ruler...\n\n\nExcerpt from The Heron Herald:\n\nAnimal Kingdom Leader Race Getting Fierce\n\nOne day after Insanolord the Jackass (or Mule as he keeps asking to be referred to) entered the race to be Animal Kingdom's next leader, Khushrenada the Cat has now stepped forward to also state he will be running in the race to be the Animal Kingdom's next great leader. Khushrenada has a history of being able to revitalize areas of stagnation with new growth and ideas as well as fighting for animal rights by continually trying to innovate and experiment against the status quo. However, despite these positives, Khushrenada has his critics with some saying he has ties to a criminal animal underworld and is being supported by the Shere Khan mafia to ensure their interests and stranglehold on the Animal Kingdom. Khushrenada's political rival Insanolord has already stated that electing Khushrenada would bring about the end of the Animal Kingdom and the ruination of everything all animals have been building up and working on for 15 years. Asked about this, Khushrenada just laughed and said, \"Animals have been accusing me of these things for years with no evidence to support their claims yet to appear. Facts are that I've done more to build the Animal Kingdom than most and the history of this land backs me up on this. I have no ties to the Shere Khan Mafia and do not know where this spurious slander has come from.\"\n\n\nExcerpt from The Insect Inquisitor:\n\nHas Man Entered the Animal Kingdom Again?\n\nOblivion the Ox was found dead in the Serengeti Swamp. Bystanders say they heard a loud bang before Oblivion's collapse with others saying they saw a shadowy two-legged creature move quickly from some nearby bushes and climb onto a strange wheeled beast that took off at high speed. Police Chief Rin Tin Tin has said that he is still investigating the matter and doesn't want to jump to any conclusion too soon. He asks that the public not become panicked or spooked too hastily because of rumours. Unfortunately, a lemming colony has already run over a cliff in fear from the news and died in what other lemmings are calling a typical Tuesday. Despite calls for calmness from the police, many animals are arming themselves in an effort to provide a measure of security for their wellbeing. With the Animal Kingdom election already causing much divide throughout the land, officials worry that this current climate of fear could lead to a bloodshed if the citizenry are not careful.\n\n\nCitizenry Arming Themselves:\n\nYou've heard the legends.

There are two gangs who dominate the town:  The Fanboys and The Pietriots.  They've been at war with each other and often the townsfolk are the collateral damage.  The town has had enough and has decided to fight back with swift, but often cruel, justice.  Mistakes will be made, but the town has hired an expert:  Detective Dick.  \n\nUnfortunately, there's a serial killer also on the loose.  The town will have to be judicious in whom they choose to execute daily.  Keep your friends close and your enemies closer; play to win, but win to play; another lame cliche.  \n\nHere are the roles and rules associated with them:\n\nThe Fanboys -  This gang of three will have all odd days (starting with Day 1, go figure.)  They are comprised of one Godfather (who will be the sole person responsible for messaging the narrator--yours truly--about who he wants dead) and two henchmen.\n\nThe Pietriots-- This gang of three with have all even days (day 2!  see how that works?)  They too will have one Godfather and two henchmen.\n\nDectective Dick--Every night he can investigate one person.  The Godfathers will be found as townies.  He may choose to share the info with whomever he trusts, but he cannot kill anyone.\n\nThe Serial Killer--This man is something awful.  Every other night (even nights) he heartlessly kills a random townie.\n\nDoctor Zorders--He has the ability to protect one townie each night.  Unfortunately, he cannot protect himself.      If the mafia should put a hit on whomever he has protected, they still get to take a hit on someone else.  He's most helpful when he doesn't protect mafia.\n\nTown Whore-- This sassy lady has the ability to change any townie's vote.  This role is useful in tight elections.  The town whore cannot make a tie, but she can BREAK a tie.  \n\nTownies -- Innocent, kind, God-fearing individuals who are out for revenge against the bastards who are killing them.  \n\nTHE VIGILANTE:  The vigilante is on the side of the townies and is after the Mafia guys.  He can kill one person a night.

This one is fairly big, so I need a good signup.  Bring in peoples if you must.\n\nThe rules work exactly the same as the last.  But I will recap the general rules:\n\nRule 1)  You vote for someone\n\nRule 2)  Everyone may vote, regarldess of whether or not you have a special role\n\nRule 3)  You may change your vote at any time.  \n\nRule 4)  You may form alliances and be sneaky while you live, BUT IF YOU DIE, SHUT UP!\n\n\nNow, for the game specific rules:\n\nTwo Mafias in this game again.  Each one has four members.  But both have one shared member.  That man is THE RAT.\n\nThe Reggie Mafia --  4 members -  1 is the Godfather:  Reggie; 1 is THE RAT;  and three henchmen;  they get to vote someone out on every odd day.\n\nThe Kaplan Mafia --  4 members -  1 is the Godmother:  Kaplan; 1 is THE RAT; and three henchmen;  they get to vote someone out on every even day.\n\nAgent  7  --   The Detective.  He gets to inspect one person every night.  Only thing is, if he inspects either of the Godpeoples, they come off as innocent.  On the third night, he gets a freebie from THE RAT.\n\nThe Vigilante --  He can kill one person each night.  But, if he kills anyone who isn't mafia, he dies a horrible death.\n\nCaptain Lavender -- This man has the ability to raise the dead one time regardless of whether or not he's killed.  He cannot raise himself from the dead.  But at any point in the game, he may resurrect one player.  He can also reassign the player to another role.  While he may not add additional roles (i.e. an extra cop, vigilante, or Rat) he may replace them (i.e. a dead cop, a dead vigilante, a dead Godfather).  So, watch out, with Captain Lavender's special powers, that guy who you thought was your faithful mafia friend may now be a townie;  or that cop might now be a mafioso.\n\nAnd the star of the show\n\nTHE RAT:  He belongs to both mafias, but holds no allegiance.  On every third day, he will reveal one mafia member to the game master,  the game master will then reveal that mafia member to Agent 7.  On that third day, Agent 7 will not be allowed to investigate anyone as he is given a freebie.  If THE RAT should survive the annihalation of both Mafias, he then works on his own and will proceed to attempt the wholesale slaughter of the entire town.\n\nAnd of course:\n\nThe Townies -- the regular everyday people who just want to survive and vote out the evil mafia members who are trying to kill them off.\n\nThe setting will be:\n\nThe City of Dugufubuwat "], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.916169"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.916169"]]

He was careful to avoid any mention of Dafagabawat, due to the utter nihilism of the event.\n\nSoon, the drastic measure was on everyone’s lips.  Ninja and Pirate killings were constantly on the minds of everyday townies.  The idea was soon adopted by Rio’s mayor, but with a caveat.\n\n“We certainly cannot proceed in this fashion without some kind of safeguarding!  The idea of killing citizens off daily without some sort of trial is unfathomable.  So, as a compromise, I have randomly chosen a defense attorney and judge.  Should either of them die, they will then choose their successor; should the successor die, he will again choose who shall follow his footsteps.  We can only pray that these jobs do not fall in the wrong hands!”\n\nThe Rules:\n\nEveryday each townsperson is allowed to vote for whomever he believes is either a Pirate or a Ninja.  Since all roles remain anonymous, Pirates and Ninjas will vote along with the townies.\n\nIf a player does not vote within a two day time-frame, that person shall be considered deceased.  However, if a player contacts the game-master to say that he will be gone for more than two days for whatever reason, then the player will be granted leave without penalty.\n\nPirates and Ninjas will have kills on alternating days (Pirates odd days Ninjas even days—these are not based on calendar numbers, but rather on game days, i.e. day 1 is odd, day 2 is even).  The only ones who may contact the game-master with the kill will be the head of either group.  The heads of the Pirates and Ninjas are Sweet Pete and Storm Snake respectively.  Each faction will have four members, the head and three henchmen.\n\nNow, without further ado, I present to you the:\n\nDramatis Personae\n\nPirates – Odd Days\n\nHeaded by the fearsome Sweet Pete, Pirate of the Jungle, this scruffy band makes the town’s lives a living hell by looting and pillaging.  Somehow, though, they rarely get caught and the town simply can’t distinguish between them, the Ninjas, nor themselves.  This very well may have something to do with the town’s cultural diversity.\n\n\nNinjas – Even Days\n\nSome consider these men to be the greater foes of the town.  Despite their leader’s name, Storm Snake, being widely known, all else about them remains a mystery.  They hold no love for either Pirate or Townsfolk and kill indiscriminately.  They’re shady, stealthy, and totally sweet.  \n\nSenhor Policia – The head of the Detective Unit of Rio de Setembro (DUR), he runs a nightly investigation on each town member.  Due to the relatively unsophisticated computer system of the town, he can only get information on one townsperson each night.  Unfortunately, due to the strict laws preventing any actual police work, he cannot act upon any of his investigations by killing anyone.  Also, the Mafia leaders (godfathers) are invisible to Senhor Policia as they are experts at hiding in plain sight.\n\nPiranha – This saucy maiden is quite beguiling.  She’s exceedingly wealthy, yet has never held an actual job.  How she makes her money is quite a mystery, but it may have something to do with her connections with the town’s elite and her nightly parties.\n\nIwamatsu the Ronin – This samurai immigrated to Rio to escape his violent past.  But the Ninjas have brought dishonor to his culture.  He has decided to take up arms each night and do battle against them.  But, he has sworn to himself, should he kill an innocent, he will perform seppuku. \n\nBlue Bangs – A former pirate, his gang was destroyed by Sweet Pete’s rotten bunch.  He holed up with a former Ninja master and has learned the ways of Ninjutsu, making him the first ever Ninja Pirate.  His guiding light is burning hatred.  Every night he may kill off any person he chooses.\n\nTHE COURT SYSTEM\n\nThe Townies act as the Prosecutor by voting up one man whose fate will be decided by:\n\nPhoenix Wright – Defense Attorney\n\nThis man was specially picked by the mayor.  Each night he has to decide whether or not to defend the man chosen to be prosecuted.  If he refuses, the chosen dies, if he accepts then the final decision goes to:\n\nJudge Wapner\n\nWhen Phoenix decides to defend a townie, he makes the Guilty or Not Guilty call.\n\nAnyone who is on the docket cannot be killed that night as he is under protection of the jail guards.\n\nIMPORTANT – THESE ROLES WILL BE PASSED ON SHOULD THEY DIE.   THE PERSON WHO HOLDS THESE ROLES WILL CHOOSE HIS SUCCESSOR.  WHEN THERE ARE FIVE OR FEWER TOWNIES, THESE POSITIONS WILL BE LIQUIDATED.\n\nAnd of course The Good People of Rio de Setembro."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.918629"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.918629"]]

Two factions have formed and each has everything to lose and everything to gain by either losing or winning the war.  \n\nBoth sides have come upon new technologies that could finally devestate the other and have hired operatives specialized in infiltration.\n\nThese nations are:\n\nThe Confederation of Wii\n\nand \n\nSonyfornia\n\n\nThe poor citizens have suffered long enough and wish to return to the peace and prosperity they once shared.  But millions had already chosen sides long before the first shot was fired.  Righteous, misguided anger seems to poison the very air that everyone breaths.  But a  few citizens have had enough and have decided to take the war to The Confederation and Sonyfornia and stop them both.\n\nThe roles include:\n\nThe Confederation Spys:  Two men headed by a leader, Moto.  They plan on releasing a virus that will destroy the very foundation of Sonyfornia's massive army.  Moto is completely invisible to the Citizen's Emissary.  They have one kill on odd days.  Moto must assign a henchman to each killing.\n\nSonyfornia Spec Ops:  Two men headed by a leader, Kurt.  They plan on intercepting the Spys and send recon info back to base so the Sonyfornian Chief General can crush the Confederation with their massive weaponry.  Kurt is invisible to the Citizen's Emissary.  They have one kill on even days.  Kurt must assign a henchman to each killing.\n\nBill -  He is a wealthy citizen who plans on destroying both sides on his own terms.  But in order to do so he needs to form a powerful team.  Each night he looks to recruit the right man for the job.  His hope is to find...\n\nPeter - A charismatic man who knows how to pull a team together.  If Bill finds him, he will automaticaly recruit...\n\nJ - A computer hacker of devestating ability.  He has sided with the citizens, but has become more militant in his desire to destroy both companies.  Joining up with Bill and Peter is right up his alley.\n\nTogether, the three form the X-Team.  If they form, they will have one kill each night.  Citizen fighters are simply collatoral damage.  They are all invisible to the Citizen's Emissary unless they have formed together.  At which point none of them have the immunity of Kurt or Moto.  Bill will assign the henchman for each killing.\n\nCitzen's Emissary -  Working for the citizens, the emissary is a man of incredible stealth and intelligence, he has the ability to either investigate or kill each night.  He works side by side with. . .\n\nThe Emissary's Deputy - He has the ability to protect someone each night.  Anyone he protects is not only untouchable by the three groups, but also immune to being voted out the next day by the Citizens.  The deputy, however, cannot protect the Emissary.\n\nThe Defenders of the Keep - These three are a group of citizens who set up ingenious obstacles.  They can prevent one person from being killed each night.  Not only that, but if they successfully block a target, the group cannot make another strike that night.  So, if the Confederation should make a hit on Mr. X, and he is protected by the Defenders, then that night they go without a kill.\n\nThe Downtrodden Man - This is a man who has lost all hope for the future.  He plans on the night of the third day to strike out and kill two people with him.  If he succeeds in killing at least one member of the three fighting factions, he will live to strike one more time on day five.  If this man is voted out, he will take out the last person who votes for him.  If any of the assigned henchmen kill the DM, he dies. If the Emissary kills the DM, the DM gets to pick one other person to die with him. If the last person to vote for the DM is protected by the Emissary's assistant, then he will not die.  If a Mafia member is protected and kills the DM, then he will not die.  These are the only ways to kill the DM without casualties.\n\nThe Citizens - Unkown to eachother, they hope to rid themselves of both factions and start a new government of peace.\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.923310"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.923310"]]

Why did she get up early again?  Oh yeah!  She knew it was supposed to rain today, the best time to hook an elusive Coelacanth.  After cramming her fishing pole into her dress, she made her way outside.  As the news had forecasted, a steady rain was falling.  Pulling out her stylish umbrella, she skipped merrily down to the beach.  Once there, she started walking as to avoid scaring away her unsuspecting prey.  A shadow!  She cast her line in the direction the shadow was looking.  The fish then turned and swam the other direction!  \"Augh!,\" she murmured, as she cast her line again....and again...and again...Finally she hooked the fish!  \"A SEABASS?

She caught another sea bass, and another...and another...\"Where are all the good fish!?,\" she cried out in disgust.  Then a unusually large shadow caught her eye.

I am the Mayor of Beanerville, Mayor Aurion.  As you can see, Beanerville isn't exactly your usual, friendly Animal Crossing town.  Rather, we've pulled in some dark individuals that thrive on ambition and deceit...And I don't just mean the usual \"tree choppers.\"  It's not a secret that the local monopolizing raccoon, Tom Nook, and his trusty \"Crooked Cranny 'Coons\" are at war with Black Market veteran Crazy Redd; bodies are found all the time!  And if that were bad enough, I've been receiving suicide bomb threats for the past few weeks!  But no matter, I've decided enough is enough...All of the villagers will be locked inside the town until this matter is sorted out.  Good luck to all of you...\n\n~Mayor Aurion\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow the prologue is out of the way, let me introduce you to the roles of the game!\n\nMayor Aurion - That's me, your loving grandfather figure!  I'll be monitoring your progress and tallying your votes...\n\nCrooked Cranny 'Coons - The \"top dog\" gang in town...The Godfather, Tom Nook, has been monopolizing the market for years.  Because they don't know the members of the Black Market Foxes, they will take out everyone in the town with them, but only on odd days...(Tom Nook's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nBlack Market Foxes - The Godfather of this gang, Crazy Redd, decided to take advantage of Tom Nook's price gouging monopoly a few months back, and has been undercutting the prices of all of Nook's goods (legal and not-so legal) ever since...Like the 'Coons, they wish to get rid of their enemy as soon as possible...They will make hits on even days...(Crazy Redd's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nDetective Copper - our local cop has taken it upon himself to locate the members of each gang and bring them to justice.  Being the perfectionist he is, he only investigates the identity of one town member each night.\n\nMint - This spunky squirrel gets around town faster than anyone, and if you've played Animal Crossing, you know just how fast it is to get around town...With her powers of \"persuasion,\" she is able to sway a close vote in the direction she desires every night...\n\nBlanca - A mysterious foreigner made her way into town before the gates were closed.  She can steal the face of a single person at any point in the game (overnight), killing the original owner of the role in the process...If Blanca ends up wishing to kill someone who is being targetted by Death or Mafia, Blanca will reach the victim first...If Blanca kills Cube, she will die...\n\nK.K. Slider - The local guitar-strumming legend is also an ally of justice...Upset at the general lack of motivation of the Villagers in tracking down the scum of Beanerville, he's become a vigilante...He has enough time to plan one attack on a single person every night, but if kills an innocent his life is forfeit...\n\nDeath AKA Mr. Resetti - Who we believe to be a very strict anti-reset mole is actually a messenger from above...He can leave his hole every night to kill one person of his choice...However, if he kills Sable, he will forfeit his position in this world as well...EDIT: I forgot to note that Detective Copper sees Death as a Villager as well...\n\nGuardian Angel AKA Sable - The calm seamstress is the second messenger sent from the other side...She knows the intentions of Death every night, and can protect a single person from Death's touch over the course of the game...otherwise, she can protect one person a night...I guess it's also important to note that Detective Copper is not a medium (one who can see ghosts), and thus Sable's identity to him is \"Villager\"...\n\nCube the Suicide Penguin - This crazy penguin is the most dangerous character of the game, and there is no reasoning for his threats...\n- can choose 2 people to kill on one night, but he also dies\n- if he is killed over-night, the person that killed him also dies\n- if he is voted off, all of those who voted for him will die\n\nBomber's Apprentice - Unfortunately, Cube has taken in an apprentice...When or if Cube dies, his protege will take over the role of Suicide Bomber...It is also important to note that the Apprentice could be ANYONE in the game, even if they already have a role...If the Apprentice has another role, their other role will be their identity if they are investigated...\n\nVillagers - Innocent townies who just want to live the rest of their lives fishing, gardening, and insect catching in peace..."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.925859"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.925859"]]

Some craved the happiness they once had.\n\nTwo opposing groups intended to use fear to achieve their goals.  Pokemon were either with them or against them.  If they were against them, they were as good as dead in their minds.\n\nThe leader of one group pictured himself snapping the necks of anyone who got in his way.  He called his crew “Snap.”\n\nThe other group couldn't think of a good name.  The leader thought, “Wouldn't it be cool if we just stuck two random letters together?”  From that point on, they were known as “XD”.\n\nA third group of Pokemon were sick of what their nice little community had become.  They felt that all Pokemon, including themselves, should be dead.  Their power was too great.  The problem is, this particular group of Pokemon weren't really good at anything.  Even suicide missions were often a bit too tough and ended up in failure.  Oh sure, their target would die, but they, themselves would often walk away unscathed.  Looking at how much they sucked at what they did, the only name that came to their head was “Dash.”\n\nThe rest of the Pokemon just wanted all this internal violence to end.  They put forth a system of voting that would eliminate a bad monster every night.  The problem is, the bad monsters got to vote too and none of the Pokemon were willing to trust each other, so they didn't even know who their comrades were.\n\n\nHard rules.\nSnap – Every third night is an action night starting with the first night.\nXD – Every third night is an action night starting with the second night.\nDash – Every third night is an action night starting with the third night.\n\nIf any of these teams are eliminated their action nights remain the same.  Therefore it is in the townies best interests to get rid of an entire team as fast as possible.\n\nThere are many special roles in this game.  They are being intentionally withheld to hopefully make things more interesting.\n\nNothing in this game is a sure thing.  Every possible action has probabilities associated with it.  You will have to trust me to treat these probabilities with respect and I will never reveal the hard numbers.\n\nSome minor exceptions to this rule.\nDash will (almost) always have a successful kill if they order it.  The probability comes in when seeing whether or not they are fully 'successful' and die along with their target.  They are really bad at what they do.\n\nIf a member of Dash is killed in any way, the player who kills them will (almost) ALWAYS die.  After a vote, one player will be selected at random to carry out the kill FROM ALL OF THE PLAYERS!  Even if you don't vote for the person who ends up with the most votes, you may still be chosen to carry out the kill.\n\nVictory Conditions:\nMember of Snap:  At the end of the game only Snap members remain.  Even if you died during the game, you will still be declared a winner if this holds true.\n\nMember of XD:  Same as Snap only with XD members.\n\nMember of Dash:  Everyone must die.  If only Dash members remain you will hold a glorious suicide ritual and each member of Dash, even the dead, will be declared winners.\n\nTownies:  You must survive the entire game to the point where no Snap, XD, or Dash members are left.  If you die, you can not be declared a winner.\n\nYou cannot willfully jump sides like I attempted in Mafia V.  This will not be tolerated."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.928784"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.928784"]]

Marge was at the grocery store with Maggie, when suddenly, the ground began to shake.  She ran outside to see what was the matter, as the ground began to heave more and more violently.  Suddenly, the Power Plant that had so long been on the horizon exploded in a great mushroom cloud, and much of the town was destroyed by either the quakes, or the explosion.  Letting out a bloodcurdling scream of horror, Marge ran home to check on Bart and Lisa, and to try to find out the fate of her dear Homer.\n\n   There were two groups of survivors from the explosion of the power plant:\n\n---Mr. Burns was among the survivors, when the explosion occurred he was sitting in his mansion, discussing with his Blood Sucking lawyers how to legally sell the organs of workers who died in accidents.  In an Ironic twist, the plant exploded just before they managed work that into the contracts of all of the employees.  Burns was furious not only because he lost the plant, but also, all the employees died before he could harvest their organs.  Burns believed the accident was due to the incompetence of the workers, namely the plant’s safety inspector, Homer Simpson.  Burns and his lawyers will exact their revenge on even numbered nights.\n\n---Oddly enough Homer and some of his buddies were also among the survivors, they were out getting hot dogs when the explosion occurred.  Homer’s scream of D’OH was so loud that they heard it in Shelbyville.  Upset that all of their friends in the plant had died, Homer blamed Mr. Burns for buying cheap, poorly built parts.  Homer and his crew will exact their revenge on Mr. Burns on odd numbered days.\n\n               -Godfathers come up as innocents, if they are inspected\n   -Unless they are the only person left, godfathers must send a henchman to make their kill.  So they need  to pm me the victim and who is going to make the hit.\n\n   While much of the town was destroyed, there are still plenty of people around to sort this whole mess out.\n\n---Mayor Quimby: Me, In light of this tragic event, I have decided to gather the whole town in the town hall, so that we can take care of the mafia.\n\n---My Mistress:  She has some influence over me (because of her huge magumbos).  If there is a tie, she decides who is killed.  If my mistress is killed, I will just have to go to my room, flip a coin, and weep for all of the registered voters who have died.\n\n---Wayland Smithers was chewing food for Mr. Burns at the time of the explosion, his attachment to Mr. Burns is so strong that, should Mr. Burns be killed, Smithers will go on a murderous rampage, and take the lives of 2 Springfielders the next day.\n\n---Marge Simpson: Hell hath no fury like a woman’s scorn.  Should Homer die, in her anguish, Marge will kill 2 people the next day.\n\n---Bart and Lisa Simpson have decided to help the people, and will protect one person each night.  If both are alive, they must agree on who to protect  (So they must BOTH PM me).  Whomever they protect is also immune from the vote the next day.  I will not tell who they are protecting, so if the person whom they are protecting is voted out, then nothing happens.  Also, if their protectee is attacked, the attacker dies along with one of the two simpsons (I flip a coin to decide which one)\n\n---Maggie Simpson:  Suck Suck…….Suck Suck……Suck Suck…….Oh, and she kills one person a night.\n\n---Krusty: has the ability to distract Maggie, Bart, and Lisa, and prevent their actions.  However, he can only distract each child once.  So he can stop Maggie once, and he can stop Bart and Lisa twice (once for Bart, and once for Lisa).\n\n---Moe Syzlak:  Owner of the bar, Moe has connections from the people who get drunk in his bar.  Every night he has the ability to get any one person to tell them what their target is.\n\n---Barney Gumble: armed with his explosive belching, and bombs made out of Duff bottles, Barney has decided to end his own life, and he wants to take as many people out with him as possible:\n   -kill two people on one night (as well as himself)\n   -If he is voted out, all who vote for him die\n   -If he is attacked, the attacker who makes the hit dies with him.\n\n---Patty and Selma:  Because no one can actually see them, due to the incredible amount of tobacco smoke, they can kill once during the game, and take their victim’s place.  Like Bart and Lisa they must agree on their actions and both PM me.  Example, they must both agree on who to replace, and should they take the place of a godfather, they must both agree on their assassinations.  Also, since they are always together, should one die, the other one dies as well.\n\n---Police Chief Wiggum has decided to figure this whole thing out, so he gets to investigate one person a night, however, since he has such stubby legs, he can’t catch anyone, and is unable to make any kills.\n\n---Ned Flanders:  Has taken it upon himself to end the sin in the town, with a cross on his chest, and the power of God on his side, he seeks to send the evildoers to hell didely ell with one kill every night.  Should he kill an innocent, he will take his own life.\n   *special notes about flanders*\n   -Marge and Smithers are guilty because it is in the townies best interest to kill them before a godfather.\n   -Patty and Selma are innocent until they make their kill, then it depends on whose role they take.\n   -Bart and Lisa, Krusty, and Moe are innocent.\n   -Maggie is guilty, even though it is a shame to kill a baby.  I know it does not sound right for flanders to kill her, but I willl explain should the situation come up\n   \n---Townies:  They all just want to sort out this whole mess so that they can put this tragedy behind them, and get on with their lives.\n\nVOTE QUIMBY…..WAIT, don’t vote quimby!\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.931636"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.931636"]]

Mad Gear controls major criminal activity in the city. When they learned of Haggar's plans, they took immediate action to bring this new mayor under their control.\n\nIn 1989.\n\n\n\nHaggar:  Hello?  Mike Haggar here.\nPhone:  Hee hee hee, Mr. Haggar.  So pleased to make your acquaintance.  I believe you know who I am!  Don't hang up!  We have a little business proposition for you...  Your INTERNET FORUM for your cooperation.  And we'll throw in the regular monthly bonus \nto your salary we offered before.\nHaggar:  What?!  What happened to MIKE'S FUNHOUSE?? Who is this?!\nPhone:  Not so fast, Mike.  Turn on your TV.\n(Haggar turns on the TV.  On the screen is the Mad Gear gang trolling his personal forum!)\nHaggar:  You fiend! \nPhone:  Nothing yet...but we will if you don't cooperate.  Listen to reason.  Why make your job difficult? Just let us do as we please like the mayor before you did!\n\n\nMEANWHILE:\nCody:  What?!  Mike's Forum?! TROLLED!?\nGuy:  What's a forum?\nCody:  It's on the internet.  The Mad Gears must pay!\nGuy:  What a dirty trick!  I will help you out.\nCody: You go ahead while I try to lose this crazy transexual.\n\n\n\nLATER:\nDean: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor! The city is under attack by the SKULL CROSS GANG!\nHaggar: What?!\nDean: Wait a minute Mr. Mayor. I can lead you to them. \nHaggar: Who the heck are you?! \nDean: Does it really matter?! All you need to know is that I know where they're headed.\nMike Haggar: I haven't got a choice so I'll trust you.  But if you're leading me into a trap, I'm gonna grind you into the pavement. Let's hit the streets!! \n\nIf this is your first time playing mafia, this is a game detective work, suspicion, and double-crossing. Good guys try to vote out the gangs, and the gangs try to take out all of the other players. It's fun and easy!\n\nROLE INTRODUCTIONS:\nThe Heroes\n Mayor Mike Haggar will clean up the streets by wailing on people with a giant pipe, pretty much. He's addicted to the internet, though, so he'll only go out and wail on someone when he feels like - the classic vigilante role. His term as mayor will be over if he takes out anybody but a gangster, though! Even the serial killer, this time!\n\n Guy can use his ninja clan connections and stealth to investigate all but the top gang leaders every night. The classic cop role.\n\n Cody loves to punch guys and get into trouble. If he's voted out, he can escape from jail; he's a good guy, but he's a jailbreaker. The catch is, if that happens, everyone will obviously know his identity. Many other roles revolve around Cody in some way, too.\n\nPublic Nuisances - Some are good guys, some are just jerks\n Two-P has a choice of joining Mad Gear, giving them an extra member, or joining Cody as a townie (they will then know each other and be able to work together in votes or whatever). If investigated, only the role will be discovered, but not which side they have joined.\n\n Dean gets the same deal, except with the Skull Cross gang. If both Two-P and Dean side with Cody, that's quite a group to start with, but maybe being in a mafia is safer. Or is it?\n\n Poison, the ultra hot gangster slut, has a big surprise! She can, scratch that, will seduce a vote out of anyone she wants, daily, but only to Cody, because she wants him all to herself for some hot conjugal visits. If she doesn't report in with which vote she wants to change, a vote from the highest non-tie creating bloc will be changed to Cody. She can still help the townies a bit through clever vote manipulation and is on the townie's side, basically. If Cody is taken out of the game, she'll revert to the classic town whore role.\n\n Roxy, Poison's close friend and palette swap, is a normal town whore role.\n\n Rolento is a jerk that blows guys up with grenades. As the classic suicide bomber, he can blow up two people and himself whenever he feels like it. Or everybody that votes for him if he's voted out. Or the bottom-ranked member of the gang that takes him out. Watch out for El Gado, though.\n\n El Gado lives for revenge against Rolento. He will serial kill people every other night without consequence until Rolento is dead. When Rolento dies, he becomes a townie and loses his ability to kill people. He can win with the townies... or by himself. He's the only guy that can kill Rolento without being blown up.\n\n The Barrel contains a delicious roast that will restore a player to a vacant role at the whim of the Barrel, even if the barrel has already been taken out. It's a magic barrel that is also registered to vote.\n\n Sodom, the ultimate wanna-be, can bump off anyone and assume their role.\n\nAnd, of course, an indeterminate number of townies.\n\nThe Gangsters\nMad Gear:\n Belger is the leader of Mad Gear and will be shown as a townie to investigators.\n Edi.E is the #2 Mad Gear goon in this game, and can investigate a player every night.\n MG Goon is the 3rd rank Mad Gear gangster, or 4th if Two-P joins.\n\nSkull Cross:\n Black is the leader of Skull Cross and will be shown as a townie to alligators. I mean, investigators.\n Dave is the investigator for Skull Cross.\n SK Goon is the bottom rank Skull Cross gangster.\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.934244"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.934244"]]

[["name", "Mafia X: F-Zero (Mafio-GX)"], ["game_image", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/48/17/14/48171426a1f3ba300daf1952587d0a5b.jpg"], ["description", "The Rules\n\nGameplay\n\nFor any newcomers, this is the way we're playing the game. In the game of Mafia, there are basically two sides. Innocents known as townies and Bad guys known as Mafia. The game is played over a course of days. Each day, everybody can vote for one person to be eliminated from the game. The person with the highest amount of votes is the one eliminated. The townies are trying to vote out the mafia while the mafia is trying to vote out the townies. This is not as easy as it sounds. The mafia have an advantage by knowing who all their members are, while the townies don't know who else is innocent besides themselves. The mafia also has another advantage by the fact that they can make a hit every night. The next day, the person who was voted out is killed in a little story and their role revealed. The person who the mafia hit is also killed and their role mentioned in the story as well.\n\nVote Rules\n\nTo vote, simply type in bold: VOTE (NAME) You may post anything else you want during the day or with that message. You can only vote for one person. If you wish to change your vote, make sure to erase the old vote. Only votes that are in bold will be counted. If you have two votes, neither will count. \n\nYou must vote at least once every two days. Failure to vote will result in death. If you have a reason for not voting in time, PM me before the third day of abscence to let me know. \n\nTies\n\nIf there is a tie at the deadline, there is a simple procedure for solving it. Anyone who has not voted that day has 10 minutes after the dead line to vote for one of the people tied up. If after 10 minutes, there is still a tie, anyone who didn't vote that day will be killed instead. So if there were 4 people who didn't vote, I'd randomly select one to die instead. Maybe 2 if I'm cranky. But what if everyone voted and there was still a tie. Then, there will be the 10 minute delay to change one's vote for someone else. If after the 10 minutes, there is still a tie, then those who are tied will be exempt and I will randomly select someone else to die. Should have saved yourself.\n\nTo Win\n\nFor the townies to win, every mafia member must be killed and only innocent townies remain.\n\nFor the mafia to win, they only have to get to the point where it is equal townies and mafia. Example, 3 townies left and 3 mafia members left. At that point, it is assumed the mafia take over.\n\nNote: there are also different roles with a different win condition. Example, Suicide Bomber's win is to kill everyone. Also, if there are 3 mafia but 2 townies and the suicide bomber, the game does not end as the bomber could wipe out the mafia's advantage. The reverse is true also. If all mafia are voted out but the bomber is still alive, townies have not won yet as the bomber may have a chance to kill them all.\n\nFor all roles that don't belong in one of the two groups of mafia or townie, they are considered a faction of their own and will have a different win condition listed.\n\nThe Roles\n\nMafia\n\nIn this game of mafia, we are starting out with only one mafia. However, if I feel a substantial amount of people have joined, I will add a second mafia. The second mafia will have the same roles as this one.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nThis is the head of the mafia. He is the one who ultimately decides who gets whacked each night. On the mafia's action night, he will send me the name of the person he chooses to have killed.\n\nThe Mafia Spy\n\nAnother mafia member. He has the ability to investigate any person to see what their role is. On the mafia's action night, he sends me the name of the person he wants investigated and I send him their role.\n\nThe Mafia Recruiter\n\nA third mafia member. He has the ability to recruit people to join the mafia. However, his ability is limited. On the mafia's action night, he will send me the name of the person he wishes to have join the mafia. He will also choose a number between 1 and 6. Then, I will roll a dice. If the number matches, it's a succesful recruitment. If not, the recruitment fails. Also, the person who is being recruited does not know any of this unless the recruitment is succesful. They will then be sent a PM, letting them know they are now mafia.\n\nThe Mafia Doctor\n\nOur fourth mafia member. The doctor has the ability to protect any one he chooses, except himself. There is one catch, however. The doctor can not use his ability until the townie doctor is killed. As long as the townie doctor is alive, the mafia doctor can not forge his credentials and start practicing medicine. Once he has his ability, each night, he will send me the name of the person he is protecting.\n\nThe Mafia Propagandist\n\nA new role for the mafia. The propagandist has two abilites. Before the game begins, he will give me the name of one person he wants corrupted. This person can be anyone from the bomber to the cop to a rival mafia member if we add another mafia. This corrupted person effectively becomes another mafia member, swayed by propaganda. The propagandist can also tell the corrupted townie how to vote. The other ability the propagandist has is being able to cancel one person's vote each night. The propagandist will send me a PM of the person who's vote he wants cancelled.\n\nThe Corrupted Townie\n\nOur final mafia member. The corrupted townie could be anyone. What's worse is that no one can know he's corrupted. If he is investigted, he will only register as a normal townie or any other role he might have. The corrupted townie only listens to the Propagandist, however and votes according to his wishes. If the propagandist is killed, the corrupted townie has a choice. Stay with the mafia or join the townies again. If he joins the townies, this action will be revealed in the story the next day. He is free to reveal anything he may know. If he stays with the mafia, he will then learn who all the mafia consists of if he doesn't know yet and he is free to vote how he wants, no longer controlled by the propagandist.\n\nFinal notes for Mafia Members\n\nNew Godfathers\n\nThe mafia has the ability to choose a new godfather any day. \n\nTo do so, all members must PM me saying they want a new godfather. They must also give me the name of the person they want to see as the new godfather. The corrupted townie can not vote, however anyone succesfully recruited can. Also the corrupted townie does not need to send a PM asking for a new godfather. \n\nThe new godfather will be the person with the most votes and the old godfather will be killed. If there is a tie, 2-2, then no one becomes godfather but the old godfather will still be killed. This means the mafia must solve their differences and elect a new godfather fast, otherwise they will make no kills. \n\nAlso, when making a succesful coup, I will only PM the new godfather, informing him of his extra role. I will not give the voting record nor will I PM the other mafia members letting them know who is the new godfather. That is the new godfather's responsibility. This means in a tie, I will not PM anyone. You will have to figure that out yourselves and revote.\n\nThe Mole.\n\nWhy would you vote your godfather? He might be the mole. \n\nThe mole is another new role. At the end of Day 2, I will randomly select one mafia member to become the mole except for the corrupted townie. The mole is a member of the mafia, working against the mafia. How does it work? \n\nThe mole will PM with a message. This message will contain the name of a mafia member and their role. It's the mole's choice who. The mole will also give me the name of the person he would like to send this information too. Then, I will PM that person with a package. The package will be the info the mole gave me. The mafia member's name and role. The person who recieves the package will only know it was given to him be the mole's role, i.e. Godfather, Spy, Doctor, etc. \n\nThis is significant because if that person ends up being recruited, he will know who the mole is. The mole must also be careful not to hit the townie idiot. The townie idiot will post the entire contents of the package including the mole's role. \n\n\nThe Townies\n\nThe Doctor\n\nThe doctor can protect anyone he wants, except himself. Before the day begins, he can PM me with a name if he wants or he can wait until the evening and PM me. Why wait? Well, if the doctor wants, he can save the person with the most votes. Then the person with the next amount of votes will be killed instead. If the doctor is corrupted, he will do the bidding of the propagandist and use his role as the propagandist wants. If he is recruited, he is free to protect who he wants. Of course, he will be working for the mafia in these cases. Also, if he is recruited or corrupted, the mafia doctor may begin practicing medicine. Neither doctor can protect the other.\n\nThe Cop\n\nThe cop is working for the townies and may investigate one person each night. He can see all roles except for the corrupted townie or the mole. And, like usual, the Godfather will show up as a townie. If the cop is corrupted, he'll do as the propagandist wants. If he's recruited, he uses his power for the mafia.\n\nThe Townie Idiot\n\nThe townie idiot is a drunk who can't keep anything to himself. Any information he is given will be revealed, except for his role, strangely enough. The townie idiot is playing for the townies but he it can be hard tell. What does this mean? If the townie idiot is corrupted, he will tell eveyone he's corrupted and who corrupted him. If he's recruited, he becomes the mafia idiot and starts naming names. Consider him a whammy.\n\nThe Drifter\n\nI don't think I have ever seen this role used once. So, let's give it one more shot. The drifter has the ability to take over anyone's role. He just PM's me the name of the person he wants to become. That person is killed. Their role, whatever it may be, becomes the drifter's. Here's some added value to the role. If he's corrupted, he could take over the godfather role. Then the godfather would be in the hands of the propagandist. However, taking over a mafia role means he would stay mafia if the propagandist was killed. If he's recruited, he can take over anyone's role in the mafia if he wants. However, if uses his role and gets a different role outside of the mafia after being recruited, he still stay mafia.\n\nThe Magician\n\nThe magician is a new role. The magician can change the roles of anyone every night. How does that work? Each night, the magician PM's me the names of two people. I then will PM those people and inform them of their new role. There are some things to keep in mind. The magician never knows if the action was a success. No one else knows who has switched roles except for the librarian. Also, certain roles can not be switched. A mafia member can not switch roles with a townie. However, if two mafia members were selected, they could switch roles because they are in the same mafia. The mole role will never be switched. The corrupt townie could be switched. That spells trouble for the propagandist. The librarian role can not be switched. Yes, the magician can also use his name for switching roles and give his role to someone else.\n\nThe Librarian\n\nKnowlegde is power. The librarian must figure out how to use that power correctly. The librarian will learn a ratio of people's roles. Say 30 people are playing, the librarian can the learn the roles of about 7 others. How does this work? Well, the librarian can ask to learn the roles for whoever he choses up to a limit, in this example, up to 7 people. The librarian can ask for this information before the game begins or any time thereafter. Nor does the librarian have to ask for all 7 choices right away. The librarian could chose to wait and learn about a person anytime they wished. Moreover, anyone the librarian asks about, that person's role will always be revealed. So, if someone is recruited or corrupted, the librarian will know this. If their role is switched the librarian will learn the new role but not who got the switched role unless that person is also on the librarian's list. The librarian can also learn who the mole is if that person is on the librarian's list. Obviously then, the librarian would be desired by the mafia. However, if the librarian is blabbermouth or unable to use this knowledge well, the librarian may soon be taking a dirtnap. Of course, corrupted, the librarian would do the propagandist's bidding. Recruited, the librarian aids the mafia.\n\nThe Bounty Hunter\n\nThe bounty hunter is out to rid the world of the mafia. He'll do it both the honest way (voting with everyone) and his own way (killing them himself). Yes, the bounty hunter fills the vigilante role. Each night, he can PM me the name of a person he wants killed. The catch is the person must be a mafia member. If he kills an innocent, he dies along with the innocent. If the bounty hunter is corrupted, he'll kill whoever the propagandist wants. But, the bounty hunter can not be recruited. He would kill himself and the recruiter before will joining a mafia. Brainwashing is different.\n\nNon-Townie Roles\n\nThe Suicide Bomber\n\nYes, the bomber is back. New and improved. The bombeer may at any time, choose 3 people to blow up and die with him. If he is voted out, everyone who voted for him will be blown up. If a mafia hits him, two mafia members die: The godfather and another mafia member of the godfather's choosing. More than that, every two days that the suicide bomber lives, he plants explosives on someone else. Only I and the bomber know who else would be a walking time bomb. The librarian can know if that person is one on their list. The bomber has no rational except to see everyone die. As for the walking time bomb, if they are voted out, the suicide bomber can choose two people who voted for the time bomb to be killed with the time bomb. If corrupted, the bomber doesn't neccassarily do the propagandist's bidding. Because he is irrational, he still shows independence and does what he wants. If recruited, the bomber still does as he wants. If he wants to blow up a part of this mafia, he can. Moreover, the bomber can not win a mafia victory. He can only win by the death of everyone.\n\nThe Killer\n\nThe killer works alone. He is out for himself and himself only. He can only win by being the last one standing. The killer has a small advantage. Because he is an expert at what he does, he is the only one who can safely kill a time bomb or the bomber and not die. He can a make a hit every night against anyone he chooses. If he is corrupted, he does the propagandist's bidding. If he is recruited, he may win with a mafia victory.\n\n\nThat should be all the roles for now. I'll wait to see how many sign-up before deciding if we need a second mafia or some extra roles. It will sort of be like F-Zero Gx. The more people we get, the more stuff we can unlock. The reason I mention F-Zero GX is because that is the theme of the game!\n\nThe Theme\n\nYes, this mafia game will revolve around F-Zero GX. It was for that reason I gave no names for the roles. You can choose any character you want from F-Zero GX as your persona in the game. Except for Mr. Zero, the announcer. That role will be mine as the narrator. What's that you don't know many F-Zero Characters. Well, Wikipedia has a couple pages of racers for you as well as a brief bio of them. So choose the one that appeals to you and run with it.\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.937026"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.937026"]]

Fox was relaxing on Sauria when he got a distress call from Slippy....\n\nFox quickly shared the news with the rest of the team, and General Peppy.\n\nAnd so Fox, Falco, and Krystal boarded the Great Fox and made their way to the Lonely Hearts Inn, a vacation satellite orbiting Cornaria. Soon after their arrival, the following message was sent:\n\n\"Report to General Peppy from Fox McCloud:\n\nOutside communication has been cut off, but we finally managed to get a message through. We've made it to the Inn, and Slippy and everyone else is okay. But the situation is far worse than we thought - Star Wolf is being lead by Andross, and he's here on the satellite! To make matters worse, he's flooded the corridors with deadly gas. My team, every vacationer, and me are trapped in our individual rooms - the only places that are safe from the gas.\n\nWe're going to try and take care of Andross and Star Wolf - we know they're trapped in their rooms too, so it'll be a piece of cake for ROB to drop bombs on their locations. The only problem is - we've checked the guest list, and they aren't on it. Which means there are four traitors on board who are hiding and protecting the bad guys in their rooms, and we don't know who they are. We suspect that Andross has subjected these traitors, and maybe even Star Wolf, to some form of mind control.\n\nIt isn't all bad, though. Each room is equipped with a powerful Ultra 64 computer, and I can talk with everyone on the satellite over the Ultra 64 network. We've decided that everyone will vote on who the traitors are. Whoever the vacationers decide is a bad guy, will be blown up. It'll be tricky, because the traitors will be able to vote too, and Andross and Star Wolf will be able to monkey around with us as well. But it's our only option. I hope no innocent people are killed.\n\nFox Out.\"\n\nAndross and Star Wolf taunt Fox and company by day, and kill by night.\n\nAndross - BlackNMild. Kills one vacationer ever night. Has the power to make the traitor who is protecting him appear like an innocent vacationer to the investigator. \nWolf O' Donnel - Blackfootsteps.\nLeon Powalski - Mario.\nPanther Caroso - Mystic Gohan. \n\nThe traitors – Loyal to Andross, each one is hiding either Andross or a member of Star Wolf. If a traitor is voted out, both the traitor and the bad guy he is protecting dies.\n\nIf Andross dies, he gets to choose which member of Star Wolf will become the new leader. This person will be capable of killing, but not of making his protector appear innocent. His hold on his followers will not be as strong as Andross’s – if his fellow Star Wolf members, or the traitors, disagree with who he is planning on killing on any given night, they can choose to overrule him. If there are at least two traitors remaining, and every traitor sends in the name of an alternate target, that person will be killed instead. Similarly, if there are at least three members of Star Wolf remaining, the leader’s fellow Star Wolf members can also pick an alternate target (Star Wolf alternate targets trump traitor alternate targets.)\n\nFox McCloud - while better known as a fighter pilot, Fox is also a skilled investigator. He can determine the role of one person each night.\n\nThe Doctor - There is a Cornarian army doctor on board, identity unknown. He can protect one person every night.\n\nAnd finally, there are the innocent vacationers.\n\nThe Ultra 64 network is divided into three sections, or \"threads\":\n\n-Open Channel: Discuss goings-on here.\n-Voting Booth: Vote for who you suspect here.\n-ROB's Updates: See the results of votes, who the bad guys have killed, etc., here.\n\nEvery day, you vote for who you suspect is loyal to Andross, in the \"Voting Booth\" thread. With the exception of Andross and members of Star Wolf, everyone can vote, including people with roles. Every night, the bad guys can kill one person, Fox can investigate one person, and the doctor can protect one person (via pms).\n\nYou can lie, claim whatever you want, and even reveal your role. However, you are not allowed to quote or show screenshots of pms. While alive, you must post in a mafia thread at least once every 2 days (except over the weekend.) While dead, you must not try to influence the outcome of the game in any way. (While there’s obviously no way of monitoring pms, please honor this rule. It’s important because the bad guys will often kill people to hush them up.)\n\nTo win, you have to stay alive. Apart from that, if you’re innocent, all of the Andross loyalists need to be voted out. If you’re not innocent, innocents need to be killed off until the number of innocents is equal to the number of Andross loyalists."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.939737"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.939737"]]

Or just any forum game to play. Well, since it might be awhile yet until 18 Days posts her mafia and because she kept insisting on calling it Mafia 13, I thought that I would step up into the plate and deliver the long-lost mafia 12. The reason that most people do not discuss mafia 12 is because it is a little bit stupid. Hence the fact that it is funhouse mafia. Yes, mafia 12 is designed to be the shortest mafia game ever. \n\nNow, obviously, it has some competition since the shortest mafia game was 11 and that lasted 5 Days. Fortunately, this game will be even shorter. Yes, it will only last three days automatically. It doesn't matter how many people sign up, there will be mass deaths in order to keep this rule in effect. Best of all, sign-up time is real short. You only get two days to sign-up. Sign-up ends Dec.22 at midnight. Then, the game is played in hectic fashion over the next three days. If you found yourself busy during the holidays already, mafia just came and flipped your world upside down. Yes, this just happened.\n\nMore stress? Sign me up! But wait. How do I play? Thanks for asking Billy. The rules are simple. Simply complex. Yes, although the basic will be in place, mafias, cop, doctor, bomber, townies, there will also be a bunch of crazy things given out that just pop into my head. For instance, in every mafia, there will be two godfathers. One is legitimate and makes hits for the mafia. The other is head of a townie base. Both seek the death of the other. However, if a godfather dies, then that mafia can no longer make any hits. Thus, both godfathers will hope to use the other before killing the other one off. Don't backstab too soon! And maybe the mafia's can elect another godfather. It all depends because crazy crap is going to happen all the time.\n\nBelieve it or not, there's a reason for that. The theme is loosely based on Smash Bros. Except that you can choose any Nintendo character from any game. Yes, Smash Bros. with a funhouse twist. Which charater will reign supreme? I can't wait to find out. Since this is my excuse for the shoddy workmanship done on these rules, it gives me an explanation for said crazy crap. It's like items. They just come out of nowhere for no reason. So, for instance, anyone with the letter o in the name is immune from being filled for the next hour. Random vote. Two people are randomly chosen for no reason. After half an hour, the one with the most votes dies. Not around to save yourself? Thought you could watch Identity for awhile? Too bad. And a bunch of other zany and wacky items like that will also appear throughout the game at anytime. Like choosing a new godfather. Thought I'd forgot about that, didn't you. What? You didn't? Uhhh, quick! Look at the next paragraph.\n\nSo, at this point, I don't think there is anything else I need to explain. All roles will be revealed on the day of playing. There are some other things that will happen behind the scenes that might not come out until after the game is over. Yes, after the amount of people complaing about the rules for mafia 10 and saying I made things too complicated, this is my answer. Not complicated enough. Mafia12 will seperate the real Play-uh's from the players. I don't think that made sense. \n\nBut, how could I forget. Voting will be 24 hours, although, things will slow down a lot when I'm not on at night. Ties will be solved the following ways. Both people who are tied in the voting will die but they get to chose one person to take with them. If you die and then talk about a role and reveal info that would help your team. I.e. Mafia member reveals a townie role or townie reveals a mafia role. The team that was hurt by the information gets to immediately kill 3 people of their choosing in retalition. That should settle everything.\n\nSo, all that's left is for everyone to start flooding the sign-up thread. I hope I made it big enough. If you don't choose a character, one will randomly be assigned to you. Also, I sure as heck ain't makin' no avatars for this game. It doesn't deserve that much work. However, if you want to make your own, go ahead. Otherwise, just put in your signiture what character you are. That's the best homemade solution for this game.\n\nFinal thoughts: Basically, if you want to survive, just kill anyone and everyone you can, because chances are, they're trying to do the same to you. Plus, if you're still standing at the end, chances are you won. "], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.942710"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.942710"]]

Unlike regular Godfathers, will be revealed as a mobster if investigated, but not identified as the Godfather.\n\nMike 'Pale' Gamin\nA new recruit to the NWR staff, Pale is still sympathetic to the cause of his old friends in the forum.

None of them are gamebreaking and they'll be explained to whoever get's the role.\nAll roles will be determined randomly, name out of a hat.

I thought about a Kirby theme in honor of TYP butit just didn't seem right. Plus, trivia covers many games. So, in the end I decided to have a theme that encompasses many ganes. And that theme is......\n\nNintendo Villains/Bosses. Yes, choose any Nintendo villain/boss you would like to emulate for this game. I think it will be interesting to see which badguy is the baddest of them of all. I would prefer that a major villain was chosen. i.e. Marx instead if Waddle Dee. (A Kirby reference). But, I know many of you prefer to use the more obscure characters. Regardless, the only criteria will be that everyone chooses or is assigned a Nintendo villain. So, Dr. Robotnik would not work but Bowser would. \n\nRemember, first come, first serve. So grab your favorite villain now.\n\nThe Rules\n\nHow to Play. (If you are familiar with the mafia games already, skip to the gameplay reminders section)\n\nPlaying mafia can be summerized in one word: Survive! As long as you are still alive in the game, chances are you are winning. \n\nOf course, it is a bit more complicated than that. You should remember that there are two sides to a mafia game. You are either a part of the townie side or the mafia side. If you belong to one side, you are looking to eliminate the rival side. How do you kill players.\n\nEveryday there is a vote to choose one person to eliminate from the game. The person with the most votes at the end of the day is killed. Both sides can vote during the day, mafia and townies. However, after the day vote, there is a night action period. During this time, the mafia can send in a hit for whichever person they choose. The townies have no say in the matter. The next day or turn, the townies learn who the mafia killed and the game repeats until one side is left.\n\nThe victory conditions are a bit different for either side. For the townies to win, every mafia member must be eliminated. For the mafia to win, they just need to equal the number of townies left. So, if there are 3 mafia members left and 3 townies, the game is over and the mafia wins. The reason for this is that mafia members are supposed to be so powerful as to overwhelm the townies one-on-one. Obviously, if the townie number is lower than the number of mafia remaining, the mafia wins. A tie is the minimum win condition for the mafia.\n\nIt should be noted that there may be a couple roles that don't fit into either catagory (mafia or townie) and have a different win condition. These roles most also be eliminated before one side can claim victory.\n\nFinally, since it is a prize edition, this should be stated clearly. If the townies won, not every townie would get the prize. Only those townies who are alive at the end of the game would get to claim the prize. It is just the same as any other mafia game where only townies alive at the end get to count a victory. With the mafia, you can count a victory even if you are dead so long as the rest of the mafia is able to win. However, because of the prize being involved, only the mafia members still alive at the end of the game would be eligible for the prize.\n\nVoting Rules\n\nEveryday, a new thread will be created for each day the game lasts. In this thread, you can cast a vote for whomever you want. To do so, simply type in bold \"VOTE (Name)\" where name is the person you are voting for. You can only vote for one person so votes for different people will not be counted. If you wish to change your vote at anytime, simply edit your message and erase the vote. There will be a deadline each day for when votes can be cast. Once the deadline is reached, all votes are binding. If you change or edit a vote after the deadline, the new vote will not be counted and the old vote will remain as your choice instead. \n\nGameplay Reminders\n\nI am going to stick with the long voting hours I introduced in Mafia 10. So, basically, the voting thread will be open for 21-22 hours. This gives everyone in all time zones a fair chance to play.\n\nBreaking voting ties. \n\nIf there is a tie at the end of the day's vote, I will leave the thread open a bit past the deadline for a length of time afterwards. I will list then how much extra time will be given as circumstances may vary for me. No more than half an hour. During this extra time, any player can change their vote if they wish. As well, any player who hadn't voted that day may then cast a vote. The first vote that breaks the tie ends the voting. The person with the most votes will then be killed. \n\nIf however, the remaining time has expired and the vote is still tied, the players who are tied are all killed. However, those players get to choose one person who voted for them to die with them. Thus, you may want to avoid ties.\n\nRevealing someone's role after you are out of the game.\n\nIf you are eliminated and then give away someone's role, (i.e. Mafia member reveals a townie player's identity or townie reveals a mafia player's identity) the team that was hurt by the information gets to immediately kill 3 people of their choosing in retalition. Do ont think you can create a loophole of this rule by hurting someone on your own team (i.e. Mafia member reveals another mafia member's identity). In this case, you are stupid.\n\nGiving out information.\n\nIf you wish to tell the players of the game a message, you have a couple of legal channels to do so. One, you can post this information in the voting thread or two you can send a private message to players. You can not, however, create another account and use it to hide your identity while giving out information. If you want to say something, you must accept the responsibility of being known as saying it.\n\n\nThat should about cover the rules for playing the game.

But it is not based on that movie alone. Rather, I felt it was the best title for this theme. The Wild West. Yes sir, for Mafia 19, we're doing it old school. So, let's get out back story started.\n\nThe Story\n\nPrologue:\n\nThe evening sun was bleeding out its final light on the day. Sheriff Rock Williams watched the sky. It had been another long day that kept getting worse and he was thankful that it was finally over. Another two ranchers had been found dead today. The work of Col. Sancho Volonté and his bandits. They had been terrorizing this countryside for a month now with great success. With the deaths of Stevens and Baker today, there were few, if any, who would dare openly oppose Volonté's gang now. \n\nIndeed, Rock had already seen the effect the news of the deaths had on the townsfolk. Paranoia, fear and helplessness. It was on everyone's faces. It was expressed by everyone's body language. The deaths today seemed to signal the end of a war. Defeat. That's what it was. Defeat was what everyone felt. Volonté had won and he was now the lord of this county. \n\nRock sighed. Had he been responsible for this? He had been sheriff for so long now. Had he gotten too old? Too tired? Too lax? He had the respect and admiration of the townsfolk for so many years. But more importantly, he had their trust. Not automatically but because he earned. Because he had fought hard to preserve its citizens and to protect their freedom. Success after success. Anyone who dared start trouble didn't last long. But was the relative peace that everyone had enjoyed for some time the cause of this? Was it because there had been no trouble for so long, that he now forgot how to deal with it? Had success made Rock ignorant that he might be defeated? \n\nRock knew that his reaction to Volonté had not been swift when his band started causing trouble. In fact, Rock knew now that he had underestimated the threat of this group. That slow start is no doubt why it felt like Rock he was always trying to catch up to Volonté; why it felt Volonté was always ahead of him. And today, the truth about Volonté and his band had finally been revealed to Rock. \n\nAfter the death of Stevens and Baker had been conveyed to the town, Rock quickly gathered a posse to follow the trail left behind by Volonté and his men. It was more just a token show of force. Nothing had come of the other times he had rode out against this group. But it appears success had also affected Volonté and his men as this time, they did leave a trail behind and only halfheartedly attempted to throw people off it. After following the trail for some time it eventually looped back towards the town. This concerned Rock since he feared the band may have felt brazen enough to now attack the town in broad daylight. Rock and his posse kept following the trail as it came closer and closer to town. And then he was unable to follow it any longer as it joined the main road leading into the town. It appeared Volonté had decided on riding into town after all. Rock and the posse quickly sped back to the town to see if everyone was all right.\n\nThey were. There had been no disturbance in the town since he rode out. Puzzled, Rock tried to figure out what had happened. He followed the main road some more but there was no sign of Volonté and his men's trail coming off the main road after they got on it. How could they have just vanished? They couldn't have gone back on the road or they would have been spotted by Rock and his posse. But if they went forwards and into town, they would have spotted which is something they had avoided. No one had yet been able to give a description of Volonté and his men for anyone that saw them was killed. Since no reported seeing any strangers on the road, Rock couldn't figure out what had happened. Until Maria came.\n\nAs John Baxter, the town's doctor, came out of the house and on to the porch, Rock turned away from his view of the starry night sky to hear the verdict.\n\n\"How is she?\" Rock asked.\n\n\"She's dead,\" John flatly responded.\n\nRock sighed again, his shoulders limp and head to the floor. \"Hell,\" he whispered. It was all he could think of saying.\n\n\"Care to tell me what happened to her?\" John asked.\n\n\"Volonté,\" Rock answered.\n\n\"I could surmise that. But why her?\" John pressed, \"What did Maria do?\"\n\n\"It wasn't Maria they were after. It was her husband,\" Rock replied.\n\n\"Henry? He's not a wealthy fellow. He barely gets by month after month. What would Volonté have wanted from him?\" John asked.\n\nRock raised his eyes up from the floor and faced John again. \"I'll let you know. Not just you but the whole town tomorrow. When you ride back tonight, let everyone know that Sheriff Rock Williams has an announcement to make about Col. Sancho Volonté and his gang. Tell them that I have a solution to this problem also and that Volonté's reign of terror is coming to an end,\" Rock steely explained.\n\n\"Alright Rock. But you better mean it. This town is running out of hope fast,\" John said.\n\n\"I mean it,\" Rock replied. Then he got on his horse and rode home. John Baxter watched him ride off for a bit and then saddled up on to his horse and rode into to town.

There's the mafia, ruthless killers, thieves, and conspirators.  They work covertly and kill at night.  In this game, Mrs. Wormwood, Good Calvin, Rosalyn, Moe, and Mr. Lockjaw comprise our mafia.  Their goal?  To kill or control all the townies.  To do this, their numbers must equal or be higher than the remaining townies, with both the Killer and the Suicide Bomber dead.\n\nThen there's the townies.  The normal, good natured citizens of the city.  They work hard, sweat and toil, only to find evil amidst them.  In this game, Calvin, Hobbes, Calvin's Mom, Calvin's Dad, Uncle Max, Stupendous Man, and Spaceman Spiff comprise the townies.  Their goal is to rid the town of the aggressive, secret oppressors, the mafia, by killing them all.\n\nEach day, everyone in the town votes to kill a member of the town, or if the townies elect, they can choose not to vote as well.  The player with the most votes at the end of the day is lynched.\n\nIn this specific game of Mafia, we're playing with Calvin and Hobbes characters, locations, items, and motives.  When a player is killed, he is hit with one of Calvin's new Transmogrifier rays, which is now permanent.  The player will then turn into something else, like a worm or a lamp, and will no longer be allowed to participate in the game in any way.\n\nIn this game, there are several roles.  The descriptions in the post below describe how players with the said roles win and lose.  All players who do not receive a role in the post below will be Calvin's Classmates, who, caught in the middle of an incident bigger than Noodles, just don't want to turn into lions, tigers, bears, or anything like that.  The roles will be edited for clarity as needed, but there probably won't be any major changes at this point.  Calvin's Classmates are on the townie side.\n\nThe setting is the panels of Calvin and Hobbes.  Anywhere that occurs in the strips can be in this game.  The camping grounds, the school, or anywhere is available.\n\nTime passes during the game of mafia similarly to how time passes in real life.  The game is divided into two sections, night and day.  During the day, generally the only major event that occurs is the vote.  Each player may vote for a player to kill of his or her choosing.  In this game, immediately after the day ends, the vote ends, and the player with the most votes is killed.  In the event of a tie, no tie-breaker time will be allotted.  instead, the two people who lose the vote will send me a PM of one person they'd each like to kill, then 3/4 of the players that were voted for/picked will die, at random.  Yes, this means you can tie in the vote, pick any player you want to die, and still live, it's just unlikely that this would happen.  Also during the day, all night actions need to be PM'ed to me.  I will not accept any late night actions.\n\nDuring the night, several things take place.  After planning their moves during the day, all the roled players who have night abilities will act, believe it or not, simultaneously.  For example, if the mafia's hit ends up on Calvin's Mom, and she chooses to mend Hobbes that night, then she dies, but Hobbes is also mended.  This all takes place after a player is voted out, so if Calvin's Mom decided to mend Hobbes, but is then voted out, Hobbes will not be mended.\n\nIn this game, the day will be considered \"Class Time,\" and the night will be considere \"Out of School\""], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.967606"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.967606"]]

And perhaps no other game was labelled a \"Wii-make\" or port as much as Animal Crossing: City Folk. Fortunately, we also have an Animal Crossing game in our library and I plan on using it.\n\nBest of all, with most of the story already written and most of the code already created, I have to do very little work to get this game made. \n\nSo, if you've played the game before and can't get enough, sign on up. And if you've never played the game before, sign on up. And if you have played the game before and were expecting more from the host to create a new experience and take advantage of the new hardware provided and are disappointed in what appears to be a lack of effort and lazy attitude towards making this game, shut-up. I mean, sign-up. \n\nStory:\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt*\n\nTangy fumbled around in the dark looking for her alarm clock.  Why did she get up early again?  Oh yeah!  She knew it was supposed to rain today, the best time to hook an elusive Coelacanth.  After cramming her fishing pole into her dress, she made her way outside.  As the news had forecasted, a steady rain was falling.  Pulling out her stylish umbrella, she skipped merrily down to the beach.  Once there, she started walking as to avoid scaring away her unsuspecting prey.  A shadow!  She cast her line in the direction the shadow was looking.  The fish then turned and swam the other direction!  \"Augh!,\" she murmured, as she cast her line again....and again...and again...Finally she hooked the fish!  \"A SEABASS?  WHAT THE ****!?\"  As she chucked the fish back into the sea she caught a face-full of tail.  But Tangy wasn't about to give up.  She caught another sea bass, and another...and another...\"Where are all the good fish!?,\" she cried out in disgust.  Then a unusually large shadow caught her eye.  She cast her line, and she hooked.  As she quickly reeled in her catch, her twinkling eyes turned to confusion, and then to fear.  What she had reeled in was not a fish, but the body of a recently murdered villager.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWelcome to the world of Animal Crossing...Town Name: Vale...Population: Diminishing\n\nLet me introduce myself.  I am the Mayor of Vale, Mayor Khushrenada.  As you can see, Vale isn't exactly your usual, friendly Animal Crossing town.  Rather, we've pulled in some dark individuals that thrive on ambition and deceit...And I don't just mean the usual \"tree choppers.\"  It's not a secret that the local monopolizing raccoon, Tom Nook, and his trusty \"Crooked Cranny 'Coons\" are at war with Black Market veteran Crazy Redd; bodies are found all the time!  And if that were bad enough, I've been receiving suicide bomb threats for the past few weeks!  But no matter, I've decided enough is enough...All of the villagers will be locked inside the town until this matter is sorted out.  Good luck to all of you...\n\n~Mayor Khushrenada\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow the prologue is out of the way, let me introduce you to the roles of the game!\n\nMayor Khushrenada - That's me, your loving grandfather figure!  I'll be monitoring your progress and tallying your votes...\n\nCrooked Cranny 'Coons - The \"top dog\" gang in town...The Godfather, Tom Nook, has been monopolizing the market for years.  Because they don't know the members of the Black Market Foxes, they will take out everyone in the town with them, but only on odd days...(Tom Nook's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nBlack Market Foxes - The Godfather of this gang, Crazy Redd, decided to take advantage of Tom Nook's price gouging monopoly a few months back, and has been undercutting the prices of all of Nook's goods (legal and not-so legal) ever since...Like the 'Coons, they wish to get rid of their enemy as soon as possible...They will make hits on even days...(Crazy Redd's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nDetective Copper - our local cop has taken it upon himself to locate the members of each gang and bring them to justice.  Being the perfectionist he is, he only investigates the identity of one town member each night.\n\nMint - This spunky squirrel gets around town faster than anyone, and if you've played Animal Crossing, you know just how fast it is to get around town...With her powers of \"persuasion,\" she is able to sway a close vote in the direction she desires every night...\n\nBlanca - A mysterious foreigner made her way into town before the gates were closed.  She can steal the face of a single person at any point in the game (overnight), killing the original owner of the role in the process...If Blanca ends up wishing to kill someone who is being targetted by Death or Mafia, Blanca will reach the victim first...If Blanca kills Cube, she will die...\n\nK.K. Slider - The local guitar-strumming legend is also an ally of justice...Upset at the general lack of motivation of the Villagers in tracking down the scum of Vale, he's become a vigilante...He has enough time to plan one attack on a single person every night, but if kills an innocent his life is forfeit...\n\nDeath AKA Mr. Resetti - Who we believe to be a very strict anti-reset mole is actually a messenger from above...He can leave his hole every night to kill one person of his choice...However, if he kills Sable, he will forfeit his position in this world as well...EDIT: I forgot to note that Detective Copper sees Death as a Villager as well...\n\nGuardian Angel AKA Sable - The calm seamstress is the second messenger sent from the other side...She knows the intentions of Death every night, and can protect a single person from Death's touch over the course of the game...otherwise, she can protect one person a night...I guess it's also important to note that Detective Copper is not a medium (one who can see ghosts), and thus Sable's identity to him is \"Villager\"...\n\nCube the Suicide Penguin - This crazy penguin is the most dangerous character of the game, and there is no reasoning for his threats...\n- can choose 2 people to kill on one night, but he also dies\n- if he is killed over-night, the person that killed him also dies\n- if he is voted off, all of those who voted for him will die\n\nBomber's Apprentice - Unfortunately, Cube has taken in an apprentice...When or if Cube dies, his protege will take over the role of Suicide Bomber...It is also important to note that the Apprentice could be ANYONE in the game, even if they already have a role...If the Apprentice has another role, their other role will be their identity if they are investigated...\n\nVillagers - Innocent townies who just want to live the rest of their lives fishing, gardening, and insect catching in peace...\n\nThe game will begin two Mondays from now, Feb. 9...This should be a fun game, so be as creative as you wish!

Gadd was working in his lab on what was to be the pinnacle of his career: The \"Super Heated Reticulation Ocular Oscillation Mega-gun\" or S.H.R.O.O.M. Gun. which, if working correctly, could could turn ANY mushroom into a Power Mushroom!  Mario had to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser three times this year, and was beginning to run low on his back stock of Power Mushrooms.  \n\nThe good professor got up from his chair and headed over to his bag of standard, regular plain-ol mushrooms.  He reached in the bag, pulled out a mushroom, and gave it a good once over.  It smelled like a normal mushroom, it LOOKED like a normal mushroom, and after a quick bite - it tasted like a normal mushroom.  He gave out a triumphant whoop and raced back to his desk.  He placed the mushroom on his desk, and took a few steps back, with the S.H.R.O.O.M. gun in hand.  He fired the gun at the mushroom and then BOOM!  \n\nThere was a white light... it seemed to last forever, but in reality, it was only maybe a minute.  When the light subsided, he peered at the mushroom.  Nothing had changed!  His device hadn't worked!  \n\nBut wait.... as he walked toward the mushroom, he noticed something was different.  He looked down at his legs and screeched - his pants had transformed!  Also his shoes.  Professor E. Gadd was suddenly filled with dread, and raced over to a mirror.  ACK!  He looked just like Toad!  He reached over to his shelf and grabbed a picture that was taken shortly after last month's great rescue of Princess Peach.  The picture contained Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad.  And after a quick comparison, YES!  E. Gadd was suddenly IDENTICAL to Toad!  \n\nE. Gadd felt very strange, and went back to his desk to go over the plans for his device.  What had caused this?  Were there any other side effects?  \n\nIt was only a few minutes later when he heard a very loud knocking at his door.  He went to answer the door and was completely taken aback by what he saw: Dozens upon Dozens of clones of TOAD!  The gun had transformed the ENTIRE MUSHROOM KINGDOM into clones of Toad!  How strange!\n\nOne of the toads came forward, wearing a nametag that said \"My Name Is Actually Princess Peach\".  She was furious at the professor and started throwing vegetables at him.  He wasn't sure how she got a hold of so many vegetables, but now wasn't the time to question!\n\n\"People of the Mushroom Kingdom, I understand you're upset!  I will have NO problem transforming you all back to your normal selves, but I will need some time!   I happen to have the formula for a potion that will undo what I've done, but I will only be able to make one dose a day! For now, you've all got name tags!  That should help!\"\n\nIt was then that the Toad who called himself \"Princess Peach\" described what had been happening down at the castle when everything had gone awry - Bowser had launched a full on assault! Bowser, as well as a number of Koopa Troopa, the Hammer Bros, and Bob-omb were all inside the castle when everyone was changed.\"\n\n\"We have no way of knowing who is who, except for to take their word on it!\"\n\nE. Gadd knew he was in for a stressful week..."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.999839"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:57.999839"]]

As the first major celebrity of the Punch-Out tournament, this ear biting maniac has a lot of clout  He has the ability to knock out one player a night by sending his fellow mafia henchmen  He must choose himself, or a specific henchman to perform the hit.  If Mike Tyson is eliminated from the game, one of the mafia members will ascend to his throne.  This is done via a vote amongst the remaining Mafia members.    Mike Tyson will appear as \"Townie\" if he is investigated.  ONLY Mike Tyson can perform a hit on Mr. Dream without being knocked out.\n\nMafia Members - Will be dependent on how many sign up. But there will be two roles within the membership\n\nGreat Tiger- Not only is he is a veteran of the ring but he has what some consider supernatural powers. Utilizing his hypnotic powers, Great Tiger is able to read one person's role ONCE during the game. So make sure you choose wisely.\n\nDon Flamenco- Using his mesmerizing dance routine he has made hearts melt, both male and female. Once during the game Don Flamenco can choose to dance into the heart of the townies winning the knowledge of 2 random roles from the townie alliance. The only problem is that he sometimes can't help himself from being wooed himself if his name comes out 4 times out 5 flips and a random mafia role will have to be given up for everyone to see (Isn't love beautiful?). Will he be willing to take that chance? If his charms work, the random townie roles will be given ONLY to him, and the only individuals that are impervious to his charms are Mr. Dream, Big Bertha, and Bald Bull. Oh did I forget to mention that if Great Tiger's power is used, that discovered role WILL be included in the random list of potential townie role reveals so there is a chance he may only get back one unknown role? \n\nIf Tyson is taken out a mafia member can ascend to Godfather by a majority the vote. The only catch is that the mafia will not get a knock out that night.\n\nImposter- Super Macho Man\n\nHis experience in the ring under different ring leaders lends itself nicely to him being able to impersonate any role he chooses.. He can choose one person a night to impersonate.  If that person is the same person that  Mr. Dream investigates, then that investigation will come back \"Mafia\" even if the person is innocent.\n\n\nTownie Roles:\n\nInvestigator - Mr. Dream\n\nAfter seeing a resurgence of Mike Tyson in the Punch-Out!! tournament, Mr. Dream has decided the best course of action was to take the \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" approach and has joined up the Little Mac Clone Townie Alliance Punch-Out!! Force.  Using his influence and fear tactics he can get anyone (except Mike Tyson himself) to confess their allegiance.  He can investigate any player once a night and will learn their role.  The only Tyson Mafia member who can knock out Mr. Dream safely is Mike Tyson himself.  If any other Tyson Mafia members attempt to hit Mr. Dream, they will be knocked out along with Mr. Dream\n\nProtector - Doc Louis\n\nDoc  has always been on Little Mac's side, and helping protect those in the Little Mac Clone Townie Alliance was a no brainier for him.  Doc will choose one player to protect from death by Mafia hit, Bald Bull suicide charge, or a Big Bertha knock out attempt, so that player will be saved from being knocked out unconscious.  Doc cannot prevent knock out caused by placing a hit on, or voting out, Big Bertha.  Doc cannot protect himself from knock out.\n\nSaint - King Hippo\n\nThe Little Mac Clone Townie Alliance loves this big lovable loose short heavyweight. If they can't knock his pants off, no one can . If King Hippo is voted out by the players, then the player who INITIALLY cast a vote for King Hippo will be lynched and killed immediately.  If a player stars the bandwagon, but later changers their vote, then they are still responsible for the bandwagon.  Start your bandwagons carefully.\n\nVote changer - Glass Joe\n\nAfter multiple embarrassments and a pathetic win-loss record, Glass Joe has had enough. He will do what he can to influence other people's matches.   Glass Joe can use the pity he has received throughout his life to change a single vote once a day.  He can cancel a vote out, or change the name on the vote.  Glass Joe's ability does not affect King Hippo's ability.  Much like a player cannot change their vote to un-bandwagon themselves, Glass Joe cannot un-bandwagon a player.  He submits his choice at night.  \n\nLittle Mac Prime:\nThe trouble with having tons of Little Mac clonesrunning around is that the original has gotten lost in the shuffle.Will the real Little Mac please stand up? This is a special role that will be activated on an already predetermined date. A random normal townie will be awarded the ability to have ONE knock-out of ANY character in the game without any fear of being knocked out himself, this includes the Bomber role as well. As stated though, this is a one time ability which will be activated later on. The only catch is that if this player is a recipient of one of the two bomber suicide choices, a Godfather or killer hit, or a vote by the peeps his action will be null and void and will be knocked out of the game.\n\nOther Roles:\n\nKiller- Big Bertha\n    The punch-out tournament has been a male only event ever since its inception. Big Bertha's goal is to show the men that a female can hang with the best of them. She will do whatever it takes to prove to the world that women can kick butt as well. Each night Big Bertha can take out one participant of her choosing.\n\n\nBomber- Bald Bull\nBald Bull is not afraid to put his head down and rush towards danger. The only problem is that he leaves himself wide open. If Bald Bull is voted out, he will take out a random half of those who voted for him.  If he is taken out by the mafia, he will take out the Godfather of the mafia. If he is take out by Big Bertha, Big Bertha will go with him.  Bald Bull also can take out any two members of his choosing at any time, but that action will also take Bald Bull with them. If Bald Bull loses a vote by his peers, that will supercede his two person sacrificial knockout blow. On the flip side he can utilize his sacrificial knockout EVEN IF a hit is put out on him that same night\n\n\nWin conditions:\n\nTyson MAFIA: Eliminate all townies until the number of townies is equal or lesser to the number of Mafia. Eliminate Big Bertha. Eliminate Bald Bull.\n\nPunch-Out Townies: Eliminate all members of the Mafia.  Eliminate Big Bertha, the killer. Also eliminate the bomber, Bald Bull\n\nKiller: Be the last woman standing.\n\nBomber- Be the last man standing, or responsible for knocking out the last remaining players. \n\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.002660"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.002660"]]

The objective is to find each teams \"flags\" and capture them or eliminate them from play.  \n\nThe 3 teams are:  Team Mario, Team Bowser, and Team Wario.\n\nOk, just thought I would post the order of events just in case people want to know.\n\nThe Days vote is always the first action to occur.\nThe next action to occur is always Wario's action if he chooses to act.\nThe following action will occur in the order that I get them.  So runners and gunners actions will be processed in the order they were received.\n\nNight actions like investigations and General's identity change occur the beginning of next day.  As such, a General can not investigate someone AND change roles the same day...it is one or the other.\n\nTeam Mario and Team Bowser are the two largest teams.  They are playing against each other to see who can beat the other in paintball.  Each team will have designated Flags which will know each other and will work together to try to rally their team for a win.  \n\nTeam Wario is a wildcard team that is just up for mischief and want to disrupt the game in whatever way they can.  The Wario team's size is unknown, but they don't have any flags because they are not part of the tournament.  To win Team Wario needs to eliminate both teams before they are capable of defeating the other team.  This can be done by capturing the last flag of each team at the same time, or eliminating all the players on a team except for the flags.  \n\nBasic Roles:\n\nFlags:  Are a special Role on Team Mario and Team Bowser.  The Flags know who each other are and act to a similar way to mafia in traditional games.  The Mario Flags know each other, but can not attack with guns.  They can only be eliminated by either Vote Out, Capture, or Team Wario Attack.  The game is over when all the flags on one team is eliminated.  There will either be 3 to 4 flags per team.\n\nFlags: must rely on their knowledge of their team to lead votes and try to protect each other.  They truly are the leaders of their team, but be careful who you trust, because you may be talking to the enemy.\n\nGunners:  The Gunners are the most basic role of the game (they are the townies of the game)  Gunners start out with 5 paintballs each for the entire game.  They can choose to use all their paintballs at once or save them for later in the game.  Each paintball has a 25% chance of hittings its target.  You can increase the odds by shooting up to 3 paintballs at a single target.  So 1 paintballs = 25%, 2 paintballs = 50%, and 3 Paintballs = 75% of hitting your target.  There is always a chance of avoiding an attack.  \n\nGunners do not have any idea who anyone is on their team.  They don't know who each other are or their flags.  So it you must be careful who you trust and who you target.  Once you run out of paintballs all you can do is vote.  \n\nRunners: do not have a paintball gun, but they can capture flags from the other team with their action.  If a runner captures a flag, the captured flag is eliminated from the game, and the runner becomes a new flag for their team.  Once they are a flag, they will be informed who the rest of their team's flags are.  Runners can turn the tables on a game, by allowing the team to strength from a weakened position, and stay in the game.\n\nGenerals aka MARIO & BOWSERl   The General has the ability to become any Role for a team, except a flag.  Once the general has chosen a role he is no longer a General and becomes that new role with all their abilities.  While he is the General (and not chosen a role) the General can investigate one person each night and determine what role they have and what team they are on.  Unfortunately as the General he can not attack.\n\n\n\nTeam Wario\n\nTeam Wario are special roles that have only 2 weapons.  1 is a Paintball gun with a 100% hit ratio.  This paint gun can take out a flag or a gunner.  The other weapon is a Paint grenade.  The Paint Grenade can target 2 opponents of their choice and has a 100% accuracy.  The Paint Grenade is the perfect weapon for Team Wario to achieve their goal of eliminating both teams final flags.  Team Wario can only be eliminated by vote out.  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nActions:\n\nAll Roles have the responsibility to vote in the daily thread.  If you do not vote in a thread you will not die.  However, if you do not vote and you are a gunner you will lose a paintball.  This will encourage everyone to participate in the daily thread vote.  Besides, this game is going to be fast and furious so it is important to start voting soon.\n\nGunners:  Gunners send a private message to me to target their shots.  Once they send in their shots it can not be edited or changed.   This is because I will be determining my actions by the order they come to me.  Private Messages can start coming in the second I start the new day.  If you send them in earlier I will not count that action.  To be fair to my overseas players, before the game starts you can write me a special request to send actions in early.  This must be arranged before the game starts, and the private message needs to be sent to me over the night before the new day starts.  Otherwise, I will treat it like any other action in that order.  You will not be told if your actions hit, miss, or hit a flag.  You will just have to make assumptions based on what happens in the game.\n\nRunners:  Your actions are night actions, so before the start of each day you send in your actions and they will occur first thing the start of the next day.  So that means day 0, you can send in a target.  If you target a flag for your action then you capture that flag and take them out of the game.   The target is out of the game, and you become the flag.  This works for targeting opposing flags, and targeting your own flags, so be careful who you target.   Once you are a flag you are not a runner anymore and will be informed of the other flags on your team.  If you target anyone else, your action fails.\n\nSpies actions are night actions, so before the start of each day send in a player you would like to investigate, at the beginning of the day you will learn that players role and what team they are one.  This means before day 1 begins you can send in a target on 'day 0'\n\nGeneral's The general's actions are night actions to change roles.  However, once you change roles you have to wait until next day to use your new role.  So on Day 1 Night if you become a Gunner you can not use your attacks for Day 2.  You must wait til Day 3.\n\nTeam Wario:  Your actions are always night actions.  This means your actions will always have precedence over all other attacks.  This gives you a big advantage.  You can also send in your actions if you choose on 'day 0' for a day 1 action.  But remember you only have 2 actions the entire game.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClarification # 1)  Although the vote is one of the few ways to eliminate a flag.  Anyone role voted out is out of the game.   \n\n8 Members Team Mario/Team Bowser\n\n3-Flags Each Team\n1-General Each Team\n2-Runner Each Team\n2-Gunners Each Team\n\nThe Leaves 1 Member for Team Wario. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk, just thought I would post the order of events just in case people want to know.\n\nThe Days vote is always the first action to occur.\nThe next action to occur is always Wario's action if he chooses to act.\nThe following action will occur in the order that I get them.  So runners and gunners actions will be processed in the order they were received.\n\nNight actions like investigations and General's identity change occur the beginning of next day.  As such, a General can not investigate someone AND change roles the same day...it is one or the other."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.005826"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.005826"]]

First of all there is no actual mafia team; effectively both teams are townies. All members will be assigned an item to use according to the rules. These items will be replaced the next day upon their use.\n\nAll players start with 3 points.\nTo die, you must be voted out in the day actions or you must have your points depleted by being attacked by other players to zero.\n\nAll players are effectively townies; however they are affiliated to different teams. All players will have assigned items that are replaced the next day following its use (except the Green Team).\n\nThere are three teams: \nRed Team\nBlue Team\nGreen Team\n\nThe Red and Blue Teams will have equal amounts of players, while the Green Team has a smaller number of players. To compensate for a smaller team, all actions the Green Team make takes priority over all others.\nAs the green team has priority their action would be placed first regardless of whether it really was or not. So, for instance, if a green player and red player remained and both has 1 point remaining, and they both fired red shells at each other then the red player would die first.\n\nFor either the Red or Blue Teams to win, the opposing team plus the Green Team must die. For the Green Team to win, they must defeat all the members of either team (only one team). \n\nTo clarify:\nNobody will know who other members are (except for Green Team, who will know other Green players).\nFor the Red Team to win, they must defeat half the members of the Blue Team and AT LEAST HALF OF the Green Team.\nFor the Blue Team to win, they must defeat half the members of the Red Team and AT LEAST HALF OF the Green Team. (So, if the opposing team has 10 this must be reduced to 5 for Red/Blue to win)\nFor the Green Team to win, they must defeat half the members of the Red Team OR the Blue Team. (So, for example if Red Team has 10, Green need to reduce that number to 5 for Green to win)\n\nGreen must maintain at least half of their team, and not fall below this. I.E If they had 10, then 6 is the minimum.\n\nITEMS:\n\nBOTH TEAMS:\nRed Shell - Removes one point from nominated person. Can be used offensively or defensively.\n\nBlue Shell - Removes one point from all opposing team. All weapons ineffective except Star and POW.\nBanana - Protects against all offensive items except blue shells and POW.\n\nMystery Box - Removes one point from nominated person. Can only be used offensively.\n\nCoin - Restores one point to nominated person. Same day use. Alive players only.\n\nIdentifier - Allows user to find out who has what type of item. (e.g. \"Who has the Blue Shell?\"). The risk is if you use the item, you will have your answer and you will switch team.\n\nCloud - Removes 2 points from owner unless one point is used to transfer to someone else. Can only be transferred once. Cloud ‘attacks’ after second day.\n\nOil Spill – Randomises the points of 2 people.\nLightning - Cancels all votes on opposing team (can also cancel green votes), except for one person.\n\nThe Green Team will have 4 items for the entire game:\nBoo\nPOW\n2 x Red shells\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.008819"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.008819"]]

How can you say a thing like that? Especially when I already told you who he was! You know who he is, don't you detective?\n \nGumshoe: Heh. Oh yeah, sure.

He's world famous.\n \nPhoenix: *So why am I always the last in the world to hear about these people?* Famous for his business?\n \nGunshoe: Not just that. He's also famous for his love of Japan and his eccentric personal life.\n \nPhoenix: *Eccentric personal life?\"\n \n*Phoenix selects \"Personal Life\"*\n \nPhoenix: What do you mean, \"eccentric personal life\"?\n \nGumshoe: Ah, well, come on pal. Surely you've heard in the news before. He liked to surf the internet using girl pictures for his personal icons. And then there's his collection of, well, panties.\n \nPhoenix: Panties?\n \nMaya: What's wrong with that?\n \nPhoenix: Umm, nothing I guess.

Does that make me odd to you?\n \nPhoenix: *I don't think she's getting the point*\n \nMaya: Not to mention, a lot of that is just rumor.\n \nGumshoe: Oh yeah. I remember that speculation started when Bill ran for office against Honest Unclebob.\n \nMaya: In fact, there were some rumors that it was Unclebob who encouraged people to send Bill panties to help spread that belief.\n \nPhoenix: *Honest Unclebob. How can you trust a name like that?*\n \n*Phoenix selects \"The Culprit\"*\n \nPhoenix: You said you had arrested the culprit. How did you find him so fast?\n \nGumshoe: Oh, that's the most interesting part, pal. Bill had a knife in his back. Before he fell, he was stabbed.\n \nMaya: Stabbed? By whom?\n \nGumshoe: We took the knife to investigate. Turns out it is a pretty rare knife. In fact, there's only one person who owns a knife like that. Ian Sane.\n \nMaya: Ian Sane? I should have known.\n \nPhoenix: *Here we go again* Who's Ian Sane?\n \nMaya: Who's Ian Sane? Come on Nick. Surely, you have to know who that is. Ian Sane is the owner for a chain of magazines the most notable being The Rebuttal. Are you sure it's him Detective?\n \nGumshoe: Absolutely pal. Not only did the knife belong to him, it also had his fingerprints all over it. Moreover, a witness spotted him leaving Bill's office shortly after Bill fell from his top story office.\n \nMaya: That does seem pretty conclusive.\n \nGumshoe: You bet it does pal. And Detective Gumshoe always follows the evidence.\n \n*Phoenix selects \"Ian Sane\"*\n \nPhoenix: Tell me a little more about this Ian Sane person? What is he like?\n \nGumshoe: Well, he has a pretty strong personality. He's not afraid to speak his mind on many issues even if it is an unpopular view. I'm afraid it tends to rub people the wrong way and as such, he's not too well liked.\n \nMaya: Plus, he's the owner of a bunch of magazine companies like \"Another Perspective\", \"WWE History\", \"Pikmin Gardening Weekly\", and of course, \"The Rebuttal\".\n \nPhoenix: *That's a random array of titles* Why would he want to kill Bill?\n \nGumshoe: Well, last month, Ian wrote an article in \"The Rebuttal\" criticizing the way Mario, president of Disaster Relief, ran his organization. He thought it was ridiculous that Disaster Relief would only open up certain branches in different parts of the world and leave others neglected. Bill was a friend of Mario's and took his friend's side in the argument. It lead to some pretty heated debates in the papers.\n \nMaya: I think he only prints that stuff to get a reaction and get more sales. I hardly agree with any of the things he says.\n \nGumshoe: Me either. Each month, when I read his latest Editorial, I want to write back a whole bunch of rebuttals myself.\n \nMaya: Me too. It gets me wound up.\n \nPhoenix: Uh, then quit buying it.\n \nGumshoe: Are you kidding, pal? If I did that, what would happen to the motivation it gives me to fight for my opinion.\n \nMaya: Yeah. It helps me better realize how I feel on different topics.\n \nPhoenix: *Then why can't I figure out how you feel about him*\n \nGumshoe: Well, I have to go pal. The prosecution wants to talk to me about the case. Don't go messing up the crime scene while I'm gone now.\n \nMaya: And he's gone. Let's touch and poke everything we can.\n \nPhoenix: Good idea.\n \n*Phoenix messes up the entire crime scene*\n \nMaya: I found something!\n \nPhoenix: What it is it?\n \nMaya: A needle. I was digging through this garbage can and pushed my hand right into it. Should we put it into evidence?\n \nPhoenix: I'm not so sure it's going to be useful to us.\n \nMaya: Everything's spinning. I need to lay down for awhile.\n \nPhoenix: Don't worry. I've called for an ambulance. I must admit, it is weird waiting for it to come to me instead of me chasing it. RIMSHOT!\n \n*Phoenix gives the needle to the medical personal*\n \nPhoenix: Well, I can't find anything here. Maybe Gumshoe really did find all the clues this time.\n\n? ? ?: Psst. Over here.\n \nPhoenix: Who said that? Gah! There's a man waving to me in the lobby. Guess I'll see what this is all about since the story won't move forward until I do.\n \n---------------------------\nNovember 21, 11:30 AM\nThe Pyropizm Corporation\nMain Floor Lobby\n---------------------------\n \nPhoenix: Did you want to see me?\n \nKhushrenada: Yes. Hello. My name is Khushrenada. I wanted to talk to you about what happened with Bill.\n \nPhoenix: What about?\n \nKhushrenada: Ian Sane. The police have arrested him but he didn't do it.\n \nPhoenix: How do you know about that?\n \nKhushrenada: It is all over the news. \n \nPhoenix: Oh. Well, what do you want from me?\n \nKhushrenada: I want you to represent him and defend him.\n \nPhoenix: Oh. I don't think so. The evidence seems clear. I looked myself and couldn't find anything unusual.\n \nKhushrenada: No. He is innocent. You must help him.\n \nPhoenix: How can you be so sure?\n \nKhushrenada: Because Ian Sane would never break the rules and killing a fellow member is definitely against the rules.\n \nPhoenix: Fellow member? Rules? What are you talking about?\n \nKhushrenada: I am not at liberty to say too much but myself, the victim, the suspect, the real killer and many others are all linked to one another through a secret organization.\n \nPhoenix: What is this organization?\n \nKhushrenada: I'm not going to give you all the answers right now. I just told you that. Meet me at this location tomorrow morning and I will tell you more then. In the meantime, please take the case. If anyone can find Ian Sane innocent, it is you Phoenix Wright. And now this, others are working to help you on this case. You will not fight alone.\n \n*Khushrenada runs away*\n \nPhoenix: Right. They always say that until the trial where I actually have to fight alone. Now I'm curious what this is all about. What should I do now? Take the case of course. Guess I'll go meet my client.\n \n-------------------------\nNovember 21, 3:45 PM\nDetention Center\nVisitation Room\n-------------------------\n \nIan Sane: Who are you?\n \nPhoenix: I'm Phoenix Wright. I've heard about your troubles today and against my better judgement, I've decided to offer my services to you.\n \nIan: What? No way! Awesome. I got the greatest defense lawyer in the whole world. Everyone knows you are an expert on pinning the blame on someone else. I'm going to be free in no time.\n \nPhoenix: W-W-W-WHAT!? No, it doesn't work like that. I don't pin blame...\n \nIan: Well, I'll see you tomorrow.\n \nPhoenix: Whoa! Wait! Come back. I need to talk to you about what happened.... today...... He left. *sigh* Why don't I keep my office locked? I could prevent a lot of this stuff before it even happened. Well, guess I'll see my client tomorrow. At least he'll have to stick around longer then.\n \nTo be continued.........."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.028990"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.028990"]]

There is no godfather. Instead, any one of the mafia members can send in the hit. This means that the mafia can work together and agree on a pick or someone can just say screw it, I'm doing it my way. The first member to send in a hit choice is the hit that will be chosen. Now let's say player 1 sends in a hit and later in the day player 2 sends in a hit. But then player 1 changes his hit to someone else. That will be considered a new hit and player 2's choice will then be the hit selection since player 1 has nullified his earlier hit choice. If anyone wants further clarification on this role, just ask, I'm happy to explain it further. Finally, if the player who sends in the hit is voted out that day, his hit will not go through but chances are the mafia will make just make sure someone else sends in the hit.\n \n \nThe Man of a Thousand Faces - Due to his amazing acting ability, this player is able to disguise himself and not be detected by any who might be trying to pursue him. Basically, this means that if investigated, the investigation will come back as proclaiming any role in the game the player chooses.\n \nThe Pony Killer - This role came about because Vudu wanted a pony. So, spoilers ahead. In The Godfather, a director will not bow to the Godfather's wishes and cast a person in a movie role. To make him an offer he can't refuse, the director's prized horse is killed and its head is put in the director's bed while he's sleeping. He wakes up the next day horrified and does what the mafia asks. What's that you say? It's not a spoiler, everyone knows that. Oh. Anyways, like the movie, this player can make another player \"an offer he can't refuse\" and change that player's vote. For story purposes, we'll say he does it by killing a person's pony and puts the head in an odd location.\n \nThe Drug Dealer - Can't handle the fame and pressure of being in the spotlight? Don't worry, your pal here has just what you need. The drug dealer can choose any player and offer them a free sample. If the player chooses to accept, he will soon find himself hooked and doing whatever the dealer asks to get his next fix. Basically, the dealer can try and recruit a player over to the mafia side. He will give me the name of a player he would like to send a gift package to. I'll pm that player with the offer. I'll let the dealer know the response. If the person accepts, he will learn the identity of the dealer at the beginning of the next game day and join the mafia side. If he refuses, the dealer is able to offer another player his \"gift\" the next day. If the dealer is killed, the player who was hooked will be taken out of the game for one day and put in rehab. Once out of rehab, the player has a choice he will pm me with. Will he go back to clean living and join the townies or will the experience have done nothing for him and he wishes to stay with his bad influence friends and stay mafia? Drugs. Just say no.\n \nTownie Roles\n \nThe Fan Favorite\n\nThis player can not be killed by the mafia only by public popularity. This player can only die by getting voted out of the game since that will be a sign of the public turning on him. With no fans to see his movies he will be washed up. Alternative title for this role: Ben Affleck. Haw haw.\n\nThe Producer\n\nThis is his production and you are going to have to do things his way. His vote can never be changed or influenced by another player. If the pony killer tries his crap on him, he'll hunt the pony killer down and kill him. This is a whammy for the The Pony Killer obviously.\n \nMotion Picture Production Code\n\nAlso known as the moral or Hayes Code. As the enforcer of this code, you have the power to change scenes and scripts in Hollywood to live up to your values. And if anyone should try to offer you drugs, they'll have committed career suicide. This is a whammy for the Drug Dealer.\n \n\n \nThe Point System\n\nYou may have noticed that I didn't list an investigator. For this game, I'm going to use a system a bit similiar to my warbucks idea from awhile back. In another suggestion I recieved, I was told I should make voting and posting everyday mandatory and try to eliminate to the non-participation strategy. I'd hoped my performance a few games ago would remind players that everyone is a threat not just the active players. That said, I've never begrudged anyone for using the non-active route and I'm not going to with this game. Sorry anonymous suggestor. That said, I've always believed in rewarding the active players and that is what I have here with this point system. \n \nHow does it work? \n \nIf you cast a vote, you get a point. That means when I lock the day thread, you have a vote in bold for another player. Self votes do not count. Voting during the day then cancelling it later does not count. It must be a vote that stands when the tally is counted. \n \nIf the player you voted for is the one voted out that day, you get another point. This might encourage bandwagons but for those who are smart, you'll try and keep the voting close to keep other players from getting that extra point.\n \nI will give out points for roleplay and game play posts. You can get 1 more point a day for this. That said, there is a limit on these points. I will only give out 3 points for roleplay posts and 3 for gameplay posts. The roleplay points might come under a bit of criticism since it's a bit of judgement call but I think one can usually see which are the best of the day. The roleplay points are handed out at the end of the day so you have all day for that. As for the gameplay awards, they are first come first serve. I'll be handing them out during the day as I monitor the daily threads. What makes for a gameplay post? A post where a person makes a sound arguement, right or wrong. Where some sort of sensible reasoning is posted. What doesn't count? An accusation with no basis given, a current vote tally, stating how many hours are left in the day, I know you are but what am I arguments. Now you can still make those posts. I just won't give you a bonus for them.\n \nFinally, every player is worth 11 points. When a player is voted out, that point total is divided evenly among the ones who voted him out. Whatever points are left over are carried over to the next day and added to the total for the next day's vote. \n \nIt should be worth noting that the mafia does not get the total points a player has when making a hit on them. They can only get the points the same way as everyone else. Voting and posting.\n \nWhat can I get with my points?\n\nAs soon as you have enough points for an item, you can cash them in or hold on to them and keep accumulating them for something else. Some items are limited, some are unlimited.\n \nHire the tabloids:2 points - Want to spread a rumor but don't want it coming back to you. Give an anonymous tip to the gossip columnists. Everyday, the tabloids will be posted along with the story. Maybe the rumors are true or maybe they aren't. You have to decide if you want to trust the rumors. Availabilty - unlimited.\n \nHire an investigator:4 points - Want to get the dirt on the other players? Hire an investigator and learn their role. Availabilty - unlimited.\n \nStar Power:4 points - Don't like another co-star? The director? The writer? Then try using your star power. With the star power ability, your vote will now be worth the power of 3 votes. Moreover, if successful voting a person out, your vote will count as 3 when the point total is handed out giving you around three times the points. Beware though. If the Pony Killer uses his power on you while you have star power, that will be 3 votes for his choosing. Availability: unlimited.\n \nHire a bodyguard:6 points - Don't feel safe? Getting some creepy fan mail? Hire a bodyguard who will always love you. If you should get voted out or have a mafia hit come your way, the bodyguard will take the bullet for you. One time use only and then you'll have to hire somebody new if there's still someone around to take the job. Availability: 2\n \nJoin the Acadamy:8 points - Want to play a role in preserving the legacy of you and your fellow actor's work? Then join the acadamy. With this prestigious role, you are able to put forth your voice on a few issues. There are three issues you will get to specially vote. Bring a player back from the dead (lifetime achievement award), take away a player's points (fined for not paying dues), and eliminate a player (banished from Hollywood). Note there are only three spots available for the acadamy. However, if a player dies, then a spot is opened up and someone else can claim it. Matters can only be vote on when there are 3 players in the acadamy. There must be a majority on the issues being voted on for them to pass. Availability: 3.\n \nMulti-million dollar deal:13 points - Play hard to get and have the studio show you the money. With this contract, you have unlimited access to spread any tabloid rumors you want, you will be given one star power which you can use at anytime, and if a townie, you will randomly be given the names of two townies whom you can trust. If mafia, you get two free investigations. Availability: 1.\n \nNote: Unless otherwise stated, all bonus abilities must be used the day they are purchased or they expire and you waste the points for nothing."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.043784"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.043784"]]

After a heated argument breaks out amongst Mario and his friends, Peach decides to host a grand party filled with fun and games at the castle to determine who has the qualities of a real Superstar. Catching word of this event, Bowser paces back and forth, plotting a way to ruin this party, since he was not invited. Will the good times roll at the castle, or will Bowser and his cronies crash the party?\n\nGeneral\nThis game has no special roles, not even the Godfather. Instead, every ability is granted randomly each day, determined by a role of the die. This gives each and every player a chance to use a special power, but also adds an element of unpredictability. You never know who will end up with what, so anything can happen!\n\nAll actions happen overnight. An action can be sent in at any time during the day, and must be received before thirty minutes after the daily thread closes. Actions are not time-sensitive; some take priority over others. If an ability is not used by the end of the day, it does not carry over to the next day.\n\nThe Townies\nThere are no townie roles. Every ability which is usually associated with a townie role is now a random ability which will be assigned to each player every day, that will change every day.\n\nTownie rolls\n1: Red Space   \nThe player's vote for that day will not be counted in the tally. They may still cast a vote in the thread, it will just not count.\n2: Ballot Box Space\nThe player can change the vote of another player.\n3: Protection Space\nThe player will be protected from the nightly hit.\n4: Investigator Space\nThe player may investigate another player and learn their role.\n5: Blue Space\nThe player's vote for that day will count as two votes.\n6: Bob-omb Space\nThe player transforms into a bomb! If they are hit that night, then the Mafia member who performed the hit will lose along with the player. If the bomb player is voted out, the player who cast the first vote against the bomb player will be taken out as well.\n\nThe Mafia\nThe number of Mafia members will depend on the number of people who sign up. If we get the typical number of signups as we have these past few games, then there will probably be 4 Mafia.\n\nThere is no Godfather role. Instead, one member of the Mafia will be randomly selected each day to perform the nightly hit. All members will be informed who currently has this ability. If the member with the power is voted out that day, the hit will be stopped.\n\nMafia rolls:\n1 or 4: Feign Innocence Space\nIf this player is investigated on this day, they will come back as a townie.\n2 or 5: Nullify Space\nThe player can choose another player to nullify their ability, causing whatever it may be to be ineffective.\n3 or 6: Starman Space -or- 3: Red Space, 6: Blue Space\nThese numbers are situational. If the player with the hit power gets this, it will guarantee the nightly hit will be successful, regardless of any protection the target may have. Also grants protection from being exploded by a bomb player. If a player doesn't have the hit, they will receive the effects of the coloured space corresponding to the number rolled.\n\nMinigame and Reward\nEach day, there will be a minigame which all players can participate in.

Only the mafia received a message from me informing them of their roles.\n \nDay Vote\n \nWhen voting, make sure to post, VOTE KHUSHRENADA (as an example. No one would seriously ever want to do that) and do it in bold. Votes not appearing like that will not count. You only get 1 vote a day. If you wish to change your vote, modify your original message to just say unvote Khushrenada and undo the bold and then post a new vote either in that same post or in a new one. If you have cast more than one vote, none will be counted and it will be viewed as if you didn't vote that day.\n \nImportant Reminder on Voting this game\n\nRemember, in this game you are voting for who you want to be the Day's Executioner not who you want eliminated. NOTE: As an added bonus, the Day's Executioner can not be killed by the mafia that night. A little extra bonus to play for. \n \nVoting Deadlines\n\nDays will end usually at midnight EST. If I'm a bit late and the thread stays open for a bit longer, any action taken is still legal even if past the midnight time. Until the thread is locked, the game is on. Just be prepared to wrap up any moves by that time.\n \nTies\n\nIn the case of ties, a 30 minute sudden death tie-breaker will be given. As soon as the tie is broken, the tie-breaker ends. If a tie is not resolved by the end of the 30 minutes, then no executioner is elected and noone is safe from the mafia hit that night.\n \nTownie and Mafia Hits\n\nThe Public Executioner and the Mafia have 30 minutes after the end of the day's vote to send in their hits. If the godfather is hit by the public executioner, the mafia still gets to make their hit. \n \nVoting Requirement!!!\n\nThere is a voting requirement of at least once every two days. If a player has not cast a vote after two days of gameplay, they are eliminated and must bear the shame of letting down their team and being a big failure."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.061298"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.061298"]]

He or she will need to PM me and say someones name and then another person for the role to affect.\nCan have 2 votes for the day.\nCan send a message to me for me to post in the day thread.It has to be in the form of a joke though.Might be helpful might not depending on how one uses it.\n\nCyborg: Can protect someone from death then he will not be able to use it again the next day. Can message me with a name and I will inform them that person who Cyborg is.Kinda risky that last one but it might help get the townies hooked up quicker.\n\n Villians Roles\n\nThis game Slade will get to pick his own team from the avalable roles below.Darkfire will be on the team already.\n\nSlade: Can choose who to kill by sending me a PM of who. He can either choose himself to make the hits or can choose one of his Mafia members to do the hit.He will show up as townie in searches.Once day 4 has rolled around he will chose the investigators searches. \n\nDarkfire: She is the only one that can kill Starfire when chosen to do so.She will show up as a townie in searches.Has the Mafia pretender role.\n\nThe Apprentice: Can investigate one person a night. Avalable to Mafia at the start of the 4th day.Show up as Apprentice. He will also not know who the Mafia are until he is perminately a Mafia member by Starfires death.This is to prevent him from going back to being a townie and spilling the roles.His role will be controlled by Slade till he becomes a perminate role. If for some reason Slade doesn't send in a search then the apprentices search will be used.\n\nCinderblock: Will be able to protect Slade one time if Slade is attacked.He will die after that.Will show up as Cinderblock in searches.\n\nMad Mod:Will be able to nullify one persons ability a night.Will show up as Mad Mod in searches.\n\nPuppet King: Will be able to switch 2 persons roles. He can not switch townies and Mafia members roles but can switch 2 Mafia members roles or he can switch 2 townie roles.Will show up as Puppet King in searches.\n \nPlasmus: Can pretend to show up as anyone in the game for a day in searches.Meaning their roles. However he will morph back to his regular role the next day. If the person with the role doesn't choose to use their ability the first day then it show up as Plasmus until they choose to use thieir role.\n\nIf Slade dies then there will be a vote for a new leader and there won't be a hit that night.If someone is chosen as the hit for the night by Slade they won't be able to use their own abilities that night aside from Darkfire.\n The majority of the roles will be either one a night but not both a night for everybody.\n\n\nI think that is it.If anybody sees something you want add just mention it in the thread.

In the meantime, I figured we might as well get the ball rolling on sign-ups.\n \nTo all those who sign up, Kirby says Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.\n \nRoles/Rules\n \nAlright. So, if you were afraid I was going to do something like Public Executioners where we voted an executioner, I'm not. It will be the regular style of voting for whom you think is guilty.\n \nThere is only one mafia. Here it is:\n \nDark Matter Mafia\n \nDark Matter - The Force of Evil. The godfather of the Mafia. Because he can infect anyone, Dark Matter can not be identified by investigation. It's powerful eye-beam allows it to damage of 3 points to a player.\n \nKing Dedede - The Greedy Pengiun. His Hammer attack is worth 2 damage points. King Dedede also has a very powerful set of lungs and can suck in abilities. But he can not use them and will just digest them and thus remove that power for the rest of the game.\n \nMeta Knight - The Dark Kirby. No one knows the true story of Meta Knight but he once built a really wicked flying battleship to take over Dreamland and turned himself into legend. His sword ability is masterful and damage from it will cause 3 damage points to any player. His attack can also stun a player and prevent them from using an ability that day.\n \nWaddle Dee/Waddle Doo - The Cannon Fodder. As long as Dark Matter controls the mafia, Waddle Dee will be Waddle Doo. With his eye-beam, he can do 2 damage. If Dark Matter is eliminated, he goes back to being Waddle Dee and can do 1 damage by running into players. Clumsy oaf! However, because Waddle Dee is considered a weakling, nobody bothers to hide their hit points from him. Waddle Dee can see any players hit points and get continuous updates as long as they live.\n \nThe Killer\n \nMARX! - The master strategist? I hope we have enough players for this game. Marx, the genius, is once again posing as a harmless Dream Land resident. He has helped start this battle between Kirby and the Dark Matter Mafia. And while they are warring, he intends to slyly gain great power for himself. Marx can eliminate any player of his choosing. He will also gain that players ability which he can then use for the rest of the game until he is stopped.\n \nTownies\n \nKirby - Ability master. For the role of Kirby, something a little special will be done. Kirby will have a wall of options to choose from. Everyday, he can choose from that wall one choice which will reveal an item or ability. Kirby then has to decide if he wants to keep his current ability or swap for the new one. Whatever he doesn't choose will then be lost and unable to be chosen later.\n \nGooey - One of the choices in the Kirby wall of ability is Gooey. If that is selected, one townie will at random be chosen as Gooey. Kirby and Gooey will then know who each other is and can partner together.\n \nCitizens of Dreamland - These are regular townies and can vote each day. However, all citizens will be allowed to choose from another wall of abilities I have prepared and given a slight power that can be used each day as well."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.071510"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.071510"]]

Out of the orb came the voice of King Zaden III:\n\n\n\"I would welcome you all here, but the circumstances under which we gather are the worst I could have ever imagined. Among you, there are people who would seek to not only undermine my rule, but harm the citizens of Leoria. It is up to us to weed out this evil and protect our kingdom.\"\n\n\nMurmurs of assent followed the king's statement, but the orb was not yet done:\n\n\n\"You have all been given names and appearances that will hide who you are, and in doing so, I hope that people's true intentions will be seen without the bias of history blinding the righteous. There are eight council members, myself, and two members of the Regal Guard who will take up the voting that will determine who is executed each night. You must all remain diligent, and sagacious. Trusting, but discerning. Unrelenting, but forgiving. As your king, I want this land to prosper, and its people to be happy. I fear that if we do not stop the usurpers, all hope for our people will be lost. We must fight, and we must win. Council be true!!\"\n\n\nSilenced followed the orb's evaporation, as those paying attention realized that there were thirteen people with their faces disfigured and wearing the blue robes that were supposed to signify them as members of the royal council; according to the king's orb, there should only have been eleven. \n\n\nAfter a few moments, it was the head chef who whispered loudly; \n\"There are two who do not belong, and making it worse, their addition makes the council number thirteen: the forbidden number.\"\n\n\nMore whispers followed this statement, but the council members feared to say anything, lest in being the first to speak, they put either a target on themselves for the usurpers or cast doubt on themselves for the pending vote. \n\n\nThe castle's servants, no longer feeling the magical pull that led them to the council room, began leaving slowly, milling around, trying to consolidate rumors and combine theories, before returning to their duties.\n\n\nWhen it was just the 13 supposed council members staring at each other nervously as a cold wind blew around the hems their robes, the Regal Guard entered the throne room and motioned for them to all be seated. \n\n\nWithout warning, a deep voice resounded from somewhere in the middle of the gathered guards:\n\"We were expecting there to be twelve of you, the council, the king, the guard members, and the demon. But we also know that the killer known as Rogue escaped the dungeons and was trapped here by our magic.\"\n\n\n\"You were expecting the demon?\" A voice called out. Luckily, all eyes were on the Regal Guard and the shouter went unnoticed and managed not to blush as everyone searched for the culprit.\n\n\n\"The demon and his conjurers wish to take over the kingdom, what better way to do that than systematically remove the governing body of Leoria? They will still have to face the Regal Guard, but without the king, our power will be lessened. If King Zaden and Knight Jamisson die there is little hope for Leoria, if all the council dies, there is none. Remember this as you vote. Do not do so carelessly and without reason. There are nearly a million lives resting on each vote you cast. Take not this task lightly. You have been warned.\"\n\n\nMore silence.\n\n\n\"You may begin your deliberations, council\"\n\n\nWith that, the Regal Guard filed out the room, and the doors closed ominously behind them, leaving the council, and the usurpers looking 'round the room and each other, wondering who would be the first to  speak."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.075835"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.075835"]]

No. It's going to be a simple pretty plain version. I figure with the long abscence it's best to start with simple and build from there. Roles will be quite limited.

Basically the Cop role in a normal mafia game. \n\nFluttershy:Elemental Trait:Kindness Townie Role Stare which blocks someones ability. \n\nPinkie Pie:Elemental Trait:Laughter Townie Role 4th Wall Breaking can get a random item. Also since she does this all the time in the show she would be able to pick first when she uses the ability. It will be random the item but she will get to go before anyone else. \n\nTwilight Sparkle:Elemental Trait: Magic Townie Role Investigator. Learn someones role.\n\nRarity:Elemental Trait:Generosity Townie Role For Rarity in this Mafia game the other side namely Discord can really mess with the Main 6 and Rarity is here as a counter to that. Basically Discord can change the Main 6 against their element and pretty much useless to the cause. Rarity can reverse the damage done to her friends if she chooses wisely. After Discord dies Rarity loses the ability. \n\nRainbow Dash:Elemental Trait:Loyalty Townie Role: This is a sacrificial role. Where she can either use her ability once to throw herself on the vote to save someone from death or from blocking a hit on one of her friends. She can only use this once through out the whole game. \n\n\nThe Villains\n\nNightmare Moon: She makes the Day end one hour earlier then usual when she uses her ability. You may ask why I have this ability for her. Basically inactivity can mess with the balance of the game so this evens it for both sides. Mafia gets some trickery to use and townies have to stay on their toes and be attentive. \n\nDiscord.This is the Mafia's big gun. Basically he can turn 1 of the Mane 6 if he chooses correctly against their element. If he happens to get all 6 and he is still alive the game is over. If he dies before then everyone that was discorded will revert back to their previous status. Rarity can revert one of the Mane 6 back if she chooses wisely. \n\nFinally Queen Chrysalis She can be searched twice. On the second search she shows up as who she is. I may change this though \n\n\n\nItems\n\nAnybody can use items. Good or bad.\n\nElements of Harmony\n\nThe Elements of Harmony can be used by someone who finds them but there is a catch. They have to figure out who is the Mane 6 and PM me their guess. They only get one guess a day. If they are correct then they can use it if they wish to use it on 1 person who they think is Mafia. If the Mafia gets the item then they can't use it but they will keep it away from the townies/Mane 6 and if the person with the EoH dies then that becomes unusable to the Mane 6 because it has been corrupted by Darkness. If the person with the EoH dies and is on the townie side then it goes back in the item pile. \n\nInvisible Ink. This is more of a defensive item. You can be invincible for 2 attacks during the night.\n\nPoison Joke Flower. This item causes the holder to not be able to do their action for the day. Be it Role or night action. You have no control over this really till the next day is up. This also affect the Mafias hit if the person in charge of the hit gets it.\n\nUmbrella Hat: Your Pinkie Sense is twitching. Basically you can tell what type of role is being used on you when you have this item but not who is using it on you. Kinda a reverse investigation. You have to figure out who is looking for you yourself.\n\nAnvil:This is one of the attacking items. I am either going to just make it so that it can stun the person for the day. This is different then Poison Joke Flower in that it only affects their role.\n\nBinoculars: This item can tell you the persons role. \n\nKnock out gas: This basically causes the person it is used on to not be able to vote for the next day. \n\nKatana Sword: This item kills one person and then it goes back in the pile. \n \nChocolate Rain: Eternal Chaos comes with Chocolate Rain you guys Chocolate Rain! Basically a lot of bad things happen for both sides. This is an envirmental item and will last for 2 days after it has been unleashed. It basically causes lots of random stuff to happen to the items and roles and the Mafia. Pretty much the vote is the only safe measure unless you are really gambling with things. \n\nMare do Well Mask. This Mask can give the bearer the ability to fly above attacks or defend. The flying has a limited amount of uses. The flying, however will not reset back to the max when it goes back in the pile. The defends have an unlimited amount of uses. Basically you need to vote out this person to get this person out for good whoever is holding it at the time. Can defend against hits by Mafia for townies and can fly over items for the Mafia.\n\nBuzz Saw. This item can kill someone of the players choosing. Simple as that. \n\nFinally the Power of Love Spell. This can be used to either get rid of the Chocolate rain sooner if it is active or to get past Queen Chrystalis blockade of investigations quicker and find out who she is. For the Mafia they can use it and if Queen Chrystalis gets it as a item then she can add a member to the team because Queen Chrystalis feeds on love.\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of the game?\n\nIf you are on the townie side you want to vote out the Mafia.\n\nIf you are Mafia you want to vote out the townie side."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.082299"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.082299"]]

This role can be used in creative ways but only on alive players. If you manage to unlock the true potential of the role you can have many permanente roles but it will be at a cost. This role can not be used to take the Mafia hit and or Killer hit permanently any other role works though. \n\nStogi ( Thread locker) This is an one time use only power and can be used to lock the thread so that no votes or vote changes from happening. \n\nOther role.\n\nGreg Leahy (Killer) He can send me and Insanolord a persons name and they will be killed unless they were protected."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.085545"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.085545"]]

So no action will cancel another action.\nDay Actions:  Actions marked as 'Day Action' occur while the thread is open and their effects occur immediately when the Host confirms the action.\n\n Voting:The player with the most votes at the end of the day (adding in any special power affects on those votes) is eliminated from the game and their true role is revealed. In the event of a tie all players involved in the tie will die. Players will type out the players name they wish to vote to kill and bold the name. If they change their mind later, they should go back and unbold and strikethrough the old vote and then post the new vote. Example: (Old Post) Vote Mop it up; (New Post) Vote Khushrenada\nDeath: If you are voted out or killed by a player action you cannot post in any current or new Day Threads and are removed from play in the game. You may not talk about specifics of the game or what you knew until the game is over. You may post general frustration in the Dead Thread which will be created for you to badger and egg on other players or vent your frustrations at your new ethereal state.\n\nFestive Party Crowd (Townie) Roles\nSanta Clause (Benefactor)- This is a new role (as far as I know). Santa and his 'Little Helpers' are seeking to stop the mafia from carrying out their heinous plot while also spreading joy to the world. Santa gets to 'give out' two of the roles on his list each day to different players. Roles to be given out include: Doctor, Vigilante and Investigator. If Santa is killed, his helper then takes over as the next Santa. This new Santa is allowed to select another 'helper' (Role rules for Santa's Little Helper still apply). Gift giving is considered a Day Action. Gifts given after Thread Lock are not issued until the next day and will count towards the new day's gift total. To give a gift, Santa will send a PM to the Host with the name of the player and what gift they shall receive and the Host will notify the player. Santa may give out no more than two different gifts a day. (No multiple doctor toys running around for example). He may give out one or even no gifts if he deems everyone to be on the naughty list.\n\nSanta’s Little Helper (Benefactor’s Apprentice)– Santa chooses a person to be his ‘helper’. This person is not notified by the Host until Santa’s passing that he is the next Santa. The player is free to inform the helper themselves but there is no certainty on the helper's part that this is truth unless the Host is the one telling them this.\n \n \nBoozer (Investigator)- This will be a participation awarded role. The person with the highest number of VALID posts is awarded the power of investigation that night. Multiple posts in a row are not counted. You must wait for someone else to post before you can post again. Post edits do not count. To prevent abuse or attempted abuse someone who repeatedly multiposts and receives three warnings in a day will succumb to alcohol poisoning and pass out. Passed out players will not be able to perform their role or have their vote count for the rest of the day and night. Either a townie or a mafia player can win this role (even if they already have a separate designated role) so this can be a powerful tool for both sides. Repeated offenses in a row may result in a harsher punishment. If it must escalate to this point then the Host will make an announcement in the beginning of a day thread listing out the extended consequences of repeated abuse so there will be no surprise judgments against anyone. \n \nGifted Roles\nAll gifted roles are night actions.\nDoctor Kit (Doctor)- the doctor can select one person to protect throughout the night. This will make them immune to any action that would kill them. Doctor Kit cannot protect someone from being voted \nSuper Solver Seekers Kit (Investigator) - This allows the player to \n.22 (Vigilante) -  The vigilante wants to be a good guy, but taking the law into your own hands can be dangerous. Vigilante can sent in a hit at night to kill a player if they choose to. The catch is that if the target player turns out to be a townie then the vigilante will also die. ***Important- If the role if given to a mafia player, the role changes. The mafia vigilante must hit either Santa or his Helper or else they die as well.\n\n Vengeful Wife and Her Friends (Mafia) Roles\n \n \nVengeful Wife (Godfather) - She is out to get her party-going husband and all of his friends. She puts in the hit every night tokill off one of the party goers. Investigations against her show a regular townie. Getting removed from play leads to The Other Friend becoming the Godfather. If both Godfather and the Goon are killed then the remaining mafia must decide who will be the new godfather. No one after the original Vengeful Wife will be hidden from an investigation. Night Action\n \n Seductress (vote changer)– This is one of the wife’s friends who can choose one player to seduce and change their vote in the final tally. Day Action\n \n The Sharer (role nullifier)– This is one of the wife’s friends who can get another player so drunk that they cannot use their power that night. If they have no power then nothing happens. Night Action\n \n The Other Friend (Mafia Goon) – They have no special powers, but they will automatically become the Godfather if the original one is removed from the game.

I haven't decided times for ending and beginning days.  Being in Korea, I need to think about the best situation, since my days are strange.  The more people sign up the more Monster mayhem I can do.  So please join and lets kick of 2014 giant monster style.\n\nMafia:  The Monsters.  I haven't decided which monsters will be featured, but I do know they will have special abilities.  The special abilities will work like this.  The mafia can choose to either kill someone or use a monsters special ability.  To use the special ability THAT monster with the ability must PM the action to me.  No two special abilities can be performed two days in a row.  However killing is not considered a special ability so the mafia can always kill instead of using a monster's ability, and can kill every day.It is important to communicate as mafia and plan your actions, because if I get a special ability PM, I will do that as the overriding action even if a hit is put in.  (Obviously, if you contact me before the time limit is up, then I can cancel actions and do the actions the mafia desire.)\n\nSpecial Abilities include: \nCounter Attack:  Counter Attacks, prevent the targeted player from using their ability the next day.  It has a delayed result.  So if you use it on Day 1 night action.  The Day 2 action is canceled for the targeted player.  Freeze Attack:  This ability can cancels 2 players votes.  This does not change their vote, but prevents them from voting.  This action does not have a delayed effect, and can be used to change the results of the vote for that day.\nOptic Camouflage:  This ability can hide the identity of all mafia members for the next day.  It has a delayed result.  When Camouflage is activated, It will be posted the monsters are in hiding.  The investigator role will not be able to use their action this turn.  If they do they will get no information back townie or otherwise.   Monsters can still be voted out and killed by Godzilla or a Vigilante if the game has one.  \n\nGodzilla is the killer role. His motivation is to stop the invading monsters, and to protect the fairy twins.  Therefore, Godzilla can win the game if all monsters are killed and the fairy twins are still alive.  If the fairy twins die Godzilla must win by killing everyone…and his anger will give him boosted abilities.  Godzilla acts just like the mafia.  He has special abilities and hits.  Godzilla can choose to kill a player, but if he randomly kills the fairy twins he loses his special ability for the game.  \nSpecial abilities include:  \n1) Energy Absorption.  Godzilla can save energy to do an extra kill the next day.  Energy absorption is a delayed effect.  So night one, Godzilla absorbs energy.  Night 2, he can kill 2 people.  This ability can be stacked multiple times.  \n2) If the twin fairies are killed then Godzilla gains an ability: Revenge.  He gains the ability to perform a second hit the next day, IF he either kills a monster or the player that killed the twin fairies.  If the fairies are killed by the vote there is no bonus against the player whom killed the twins.  This is a delayed ability.  So for example.  The fairies are dead and Godzilla attacks the monsters day 2 and kills one.  Day 3 he has two attacks he can perform.  These can be stacked just like the charge attacks.  However, Godzilla can only get one bonus a day.  So if Day 3 he kills 2 Monsters, he will not get 3 attacks Day 4, but only 2 attacks.  \n\n-Baby Zilla:  If we have enough players.  I will add in this special role. Baby Zilla is a marked townie, that will become Godzilla after Godzilla dies.  Unless Godzilla is the last monster killed, in which a townie victory is declared.  The idea of this role is to give Godzilla the ability to effect the game more.  The original may die.  However, a new player hidden in the townies will rise up.  If Baby Zilla is investigated while in townie mode…he will appear to be a townie.  However, if he takes the role of Godzilla he is investigated as Godzilla.  Baby Zilla does not have any special abilities and therefore will only act as the normal killer role.  \n\nTownie Roles:\n\nFairy Twins:  Townies that know each other.  If we have enough players to make a fair team for the townies, then if one of the fairies die, they both die together.  \n\nScientists:  The Scientists can investigate a player to find their role.  Or they can try to heal a player.  They can heal monster attacks, or can perform a special heal to protect against the vote out, but  lose the ability to do an action the next day.\n\nEDF:  They are the Vigilante.  If they kill a townie or the scientists they will die, but they can kill the mafia, Godzilla, or the fairy twins with no penalty.  Instead of attacking the EDF can Perform a special action and change the vote of a player to a different player.  Those are my basic ideas for abilities.  I think the game should be balanced with a fairly interesting play mechanic devised on teams choosing abilities to use.  Anyway, please sign up if you are interested in playing.\n\nSpecial rule for ties.  I will only kill the characters in a tie.  So remember townies if you want to win you better have decisive votes because there are special powers that can create ties.  Also EDF, you will be a protector for the townies to prevent ties or cause them to trap mafia members.

However, unlike the other 2 times this theme has come up, I've finally played an Animal Crossing game and so now I'm even more enthused about using it. It just works so well.\n\nThe Misadventures of Shangri-La\n\nPrologue\n\n\nI was travelling the rails in search of a new destination after my life fell apart. I hadn't left my house in 9 months because day to day existence had got it's gentle grip on me and was suffocating my soul. When I finally decided to face the world again, I found it had gone to hell. There were weeds everywhere, flies and cochroaches infesting everything and all the cool neighbors and friends I had known had moved, replaced with some weird freaks that I wanted no business with.\n\n \n\n\nFish-Duck here still haunts my mind.\n\nClearly, it was time to make a change in life. Maybe if I started over in a new spot, I'd find the zest for life I used to have when I was friends with all my neighbors and a contributing member of the community. And that is why I hopped on the rails in search of a new destination that sounded right for me. Unfortunately, I was soon accosted by some creepy cat trying to find out all kinds of personal and private information about me. \n\n\nIf one of the first things you have to say to somebody is that you are not crazy, it is because you are. \n \nSince I did mind him sitting with me, I immediately got off at the first stop which was some place called Shangri-La. No sooner do I exit the train station when I'm suddenly confronted by a group of people welcoming me to the town. I checked myself over to make sure I wasn't carrying any drugs in case that was causing all these animals to be attracted to me where ever I went but I was surprisingly clean on that front. Maybe I had already used them because one of the animals from the welcoming committee started telling everyone I was the new mayor and I was taken straight away to City Hall to begin my reign. Now, normally, I might have objected but, as it turns out, my being mayor of the town has always been the host's role in this game so the whole thing kind of works out great storywise.\n\nDespite things seeming to be pretty rosy at first, I soon found out Shangri-La was pretty troubled. First, I found out that the whole real estate market was cornered by one Tom Nook and he was dictating where houses could and couldn't be built and charging whatever he wanted for home sales and renovations. Then when I went shopping, I discovered that a couple of his relatives Timmy and Tommy had basically taken control of the sale of nearly all merchandise for the city and all citizens were at the mercy of whatever they chose to stock and had to buy it at whatever price they chose to sell. \n\nI wasn't going to stand for an iron grip on the marketplace so I went to find the local sheriff to see about busting up this cartel. That's when I discovered there was no police station in town. Apparently, it's something that has to be requested by the citizens and then money has to be raised to build it and hire a detective. Thus, I gathered the citizens and explained the situation to them. It wasn't easy. They wanted me to pick fruit for them and deliver packages for them and fish for them but I finally was able to win them over and agree to get a police station started. \n\nIt felt so good. Once again, I had a purpose in life beyond just picking weeds and buying a new piece of clothing. I was going to help these people to cast off the oppresive economic sanctions being levelled against them by the corrupt Nook empire and lead them to a better life of freedom with plenty of bells for all. Of course, things can look great in theory but when applied to the real world, well, then you can encounter some bumps along the way as I was about to discover........"], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.097256"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.097256"]]

If it is done during the day then any votes made against him will be canceled.\n\n\nDr. Rachel Jensen: (Doctor) Captain Gilmore's scientific advisor and medical personnel. Has the ability to protect someone but not herself.\n\n\nDorothy \"Ace\" Mcshane: (Vigilante): instead of cowering in fear and screaming like his previous companions the Doctors current companion goes after daleks with baseball bats and her own specialized homemade explosive compound.\n\n\nMike Smith (Miller): a young man formerly employed to George Ratcliffe. Although he is functionally a normal townie should he be investigated Captain Gilmore will be told he is a Dalek. The Dalek investigators will merely be told that he's a townie.\n\nimportant, the player given the Mike Smith role will not be aware of his role. Thus anyone given the role 'townie' could potentially be Mike Smith\n\nThe Mafias:\nImperial Daleks:\n\nDavros (godfather): leader of the Imperial Daleks, registers as townie when investigated. \n\n\nSpecial Weapons Dalek(role cop): A special forces Dalek who's advanced targeting systems can be used to investigate a player and learn of their roles. This ability can be used twice for a night action on day 1 with a third additional use under the wing for future use. Dalek supreme, and Captain Gilmore are unaffected.\n\nImperial Dalek drone:\n\nIt's a regular dalek, what else is there to say. It shoots lasers and serves Davros. (Will be put into play when we reach 12 players along with its renegade counterpart)\n\nRenegade Daleks\n\nDalek Supreme(godfather 2): Leader of the renegade Daleks. Registers as townie when investigated.\n\n\nLittle girl/battle computer(role cop): The Dalek Battle computer leeches off the mind of a little girl and her capacity for imagination. Because of this the little girl can be controlled by the computer by remote and used to investigate for player roles with the exception of Davros and Captain Gilmore. This ability can be used twice for a night action on day 1 with a third additional use under the wing.\n\n\nRenegade Dalek drone: I think of the two, this is the one you shake to get pepper. Oh nope, it's shooting lasers at me. \n\nTie rule: God so help you if there's a tie. I may just do nothing, I may kill everyone who voted for a tie, I may pick some people and apply the 'voteless' or 'suicidal' role to them, it's like landing on a bowser space in mario party, except no sympathy for fourth place.\n\nLast time as you may recall I basically killed off an entire Dalek faction. I plan to be a bit more careful about how that sort of thing pans out this time if I decide to go that route.\n\nAnother idea I have is to send a few PMs kindly informing those who recieve them that I'm going to kill them in a day or two. I think it's a really Osgood way to kill someone off, wouldn't you agree? But don't tell anyone... we'll call it, \"our secret girl thing.\"\n\nOf course I could always do a few public investigations and let you respond accordingly, maybe lie about the results for one of them, It's a bit psychological really.\n\nOr I may just do nothing, as in not even having the two people who the town decided to vote against killed. That's always fun. Especially if I make it so neither of those people \n\nBecause there is no killer starting on day 4 both dalek factions will be able to make a hit. Day 2 will only allow the renegade Daleks to make a hit while Day 3 will only allow the imperial Daleks to make a hit. Neither faction will be given a kill on the first day which could be interesting.\n\nSilenced Godfather Clause: if the godfather cannot preform his duties for whatever reason one of his underlings may request a night kill in his place. However if both the godfather and his underling request a kill then the Godfather's kill request will be granted. On day one the two investigations by the Little Girl and Special Weapons Dalek can also be redeemed by this method.\nNight actions for all roles are due 20 minutes after the Days end. The Doctor will then be sent a list of night actions and asked if he wishes to block any of them (again this can be done twice), if you have a night action just PM me telling me who you want to investigate/kill/save."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.108760"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.108760"]]

Some are reasonably sized and could be climbed with ease. Others are gigantic cliffs that spell certain death to anyone daring enough to scale them.\n\nInside of these mountains, within an intricate network of caves, a colony of miners reside. They harvest grafituum—a metallic-like substance that can be melted to make energy—from the depths of the frozen landscape. The life of many a citizen runs on grafituum products. This particular miner group, Apex Mining, is the leading manufacturer.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarown has recently fallen on terrible times, and an economic downturn is slaughtering the labor force. Unemployment is increasing rapidly, and wages aren’t substantial to help life, partly due to an alarming inflation rise. To avoid the crisis, many companies have been looking to the mountains to try and weasel their way into the grafituum business, hoping to give jobs to workers and save the dwindling economy.\n\nApex, however, isn’t hearing a word of it. After hundreds of years in the trade, they have monopolized the occupation, and they refuse to lose their grip on it, fearful of becoming victimized by new competition.\n\nThe government of Sarown is too weak to make a decisive response. The outcries of multiple corporations at the unfair tactics of Apex fail to be taken into proper account. It seems as though there is no other option but to take matters into one’s own hands.\n\nFairman Products, a manufacturer of oil, which years ago was outclassed by grafituum, holds a particularly strong grudge against Apex. Wanting to reclaim their spot as top dogs in the energy industry, they begin to devise plans to sabotage Apex mines and to force the company to evacuate. Using stealth technology and key information of the company’s mines, Fairman employees begin to enter workplaces, setting up bombs or ruining electrical equipment and causing breakdowns.\n\nTheodore Apex, the stubborn president of his self-titled grafituum enterprise, sees these “failures” for what they are: attempted disruption attempts against the syndicate. Not willing to back down from a fight, Theodore vows that Apex will continue to control the business, beating out all that are brave enough to wander into the fray.\n\nA quiet war quickly begins. Fairman shoots first, sending in a clan of mercenaries in order to knock a particular Apex mine out-of-business. It’s a violent struggle between two heavyweights—one reluctant to relinquish his title, the other wanting his back.\n\nLet the games begin!!!\nGeneral Info:\nThis game will have a closed setup: the roles will be UNKNOWN except to the people that have them.\nBeing a closed setup game, this is not necessarily for the new players, but the game will be open to players of all skill levels.\nIt may be fun, but it IS serious: sign-up if you know you’ll be an active player.\nHave fun, most important part!.\nAbout voting:\nTo vote, use the format of vote username. Yes, it must be bolded. Preferably, put this at the end of your post.\n\nWhenever you want to No-Lynch, Abstain, or Unvote, the same formula goes.\n\nFor a vote to go through, a majority of the players must have voted on the same subject. When this occurs, everyone stops talking while the host wraps up the day events and prepares for the night portion of the game.\n\nRoles:\n\nTo use a role: To use any role given in this game, the only way to use your ability is to PM the host. So if your ability gives you the power to kill someone at night, you have to PM the host saying who you want to kill during nighttime hours. For day abilities, send a PM during day hours saying what you shall do with your ability.\n\nTown (x8 players, 3 power roles):\nCop - investigates a person each night\nDoctor - protects a person each night\nManager - has double vote power for two days (activated by sending a PM to the host)\nWorker - normal townie role\n\nMafia (x3 players, 2 power roles):Godfather - sends in hit, immune to investigation\nBodyguard - can protect the Godfather one night (activated by sending a PM to the host), takes over hit duties if Godfather dies and loses his ability\nInsurgent - normal mafia role, takes over hit duties if Godfather and Bodyguard are dead\n\nThird Party (x1 player, 1 power role):Timebomb - can set a bomb during the night (can only do this twice); he/she PMs the host with a target and a number ranging from 1 to 10 (this being the number of times the bomb can be passed), and during the day the target will be alerted they have the bomb and they must pass it on; when the amount of passes specified in the PM has been reached, the latest recipient of the bomb will die\n\n\nWin Conditions:\n\nWin Conditions will be stated in the role PMs given out before the game begins.\nThe roles present will be determined by how many people sign up. If not many people sign up the game will stay closed, but with fewer roles."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.111745"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 03:10:58.111745"]]

A kingdom wide funeral is being planned for this Saturday to honor the beloved-by-state-decree monarch of the Animal Kingdom. While the animals of the world take a moment to mourn his passing and remember the many things King Vudu was able to accomplish, many of them will also be pondering over what this means for the future of the Animal Kingdom and who will become the new ruler...\n\n\nExcerpt from The Heron Herald:\n\nAnimal Kingdom Leader Race Getting Fierce\n\nOne day after Insanolord the Jackass (or Mule as he keeps asking to be referred to) entered the race to be Animal Kingdom's next leader, Khushrenada the Cat has now stepped forward to also state he will be running in the race to be the Animal Kingdom's next great leader. Khushrenada has a history of being able to revitalize areas of stagnation with new growth and ideas as well as fighting for animal rights by continually trying to innovate and experiment against the status quo. However, despite these positives, Khushrenada has his critics with some saying he has ties to a criminal animal underworld and is being supported by the Shere Khan mafia to ensure their interests and stranglehold on the Animal Kingdom. Khushrenada's political rival Insanolord has already stated that electing Khushrenada would bring about the end of the Animal Kingdom and the ruination of everything all animals have been building up and working on for 15 years. Asked about this, Khushrenada just laughed and said, \"Animals have been accusing me of these things for years with no evidence to support their claims yet to appear. Facts are that I've done more to build the Animal Kingdom than most and the history of this land backs me up on this. I have no ties to the Shere Khan Mafia and do not know where this spurious slander has come from.\"\n\n\nExcerpt from The Insect Inquisitor:\n\nHas Man Entered the Animal Kingdom Again?\n\nOblivion the Ox was found dead in the Serengeti Swamp. Bystanders say they heard a loud bang before Oblivion's collapse with others saying they saw a shadowy two-legged creature move quickly from some nearby bushes and climb onto a strange wheeled beast that took off at high speed. Police Chief Rin Tin Tin has said that he is still investigating the matter and doesn't want to jump to any conclusion too soon. He asks that the public not become panicked or spooked too hastily because of rumours. Unfortunately, a lemming colony has already run over a cliff in fear from the news and died in what other lemmings are calling a typical Tuesday. Despite calls for calmness from the police, many animals are arming themselves in an effort to provide a measure of security for their wellbeing. With the Animal Kingdom election already causing much divide throughout the land, officials worry that this current climate of fear could lead to a bloodshed if the citizenry are not careful.\n\n\nCitizenry Arming Themselves:\n\nYou've heard the legends.

There are two gangs who dominate the town:  The Fanboys and The Pietriots.  They've been at war with each other and often the townsfolk are the collateral damage.  The town has had enough and has decided to fight back with swift, but often cruel, justice.  Mistakes will be made, but the town has hired an expert:  Detective Dick.  \n\nUnfortunately, there's a serial killer also on the loose.  The town will have to be judicious in whom they choose to execute daily.  Keep your friends close and your enemies closer; play to win, but win to play; another lame cliche.  \n\nHere are the roles and rules associated with them:\n\nThe Fanboys -  This gang of three will have all odd days (starting with Day 1, go figure.)  They are comprised of one Godfather (who will be the sole person responsible for messaging the narrator--yours truly--about who he wants dead) and two henchmen.\n\nThe Pietriots-- This gang of three with have all even days (day 2!  see how that works?)  They too will have one Godfather and two henchmen.\n\nDectective Dick--Every night he can investigate one person.  The Godfathers will be found as townies.  He may choose to share the info with whomever he trusts, but he cannot kill anyone.\n\nThe Serial Killer--This man is something awful.  Every other night (even nights) he heartlessly kills a random townie.\n\nDoctor Zorders--He has the ability to protect one townie each night.  Unfortunately, he cannot protect himself.      If the mafia should put a hit on whomever he has protected, they still get to take a hit on someone else.  He's most helpful when he doesn't protect mafia.\n\nTown Whore-- This sassy lady has the ability to change any townie's vote.  This role is useful in tight elections.  The town whore cannot make a tie, but she can BREAK a tie.  \n\nTownies -- Innocent, kind, God-fearing individuals who are out for revenge against the bastards who are killing them.  \n\nTHE VIGILANTE:  The vigilante is on the side of the townies and is after the Mafia guys.  He can kill one person a night.  But, if the the vigilante should kill a townie, he must kill himself."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.187885"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.187885"]]

Each one has four members.  But both have one shared member.  That man is THE RAT.\n\nThe Reggie Mafia --  4 members -  1 is the Godfather:  Reggie; 1 is THE RAT;  and three henchmen;  they get to vote someone out on every odd day.\n\nThe Kaplan Mafia --  4 members -  1 is the Godmother:  Kaplan; 1 is THE RAT; and three henchmen;  they get to vote someone out on every even day.\n\nAgent  7  --   The Detective.  He gets to inspect one person every night.  Only thing is, if he inspects either of the Godpeoples, they come off as innocent.  On the third night, he gets a freebie from THE RAT.\n\nThe Vigilante --  He can kill one person each night.  But, if he kills anyone who isn't mafia, he dies a horrible death.\n\nCaptain Lavender -- This man has the ability to raise the dead one time regardless of whether or not he's killed.  He cannot raise himself from the dead.  But at any point in the game, he may resurrect one player.  He can also reassign the player to another role.  While he may not add additional roles (i.e. an extra cop, vigilante, or Rat) he may replace them (i.e. a dead cop, a dead vigilante, a dead Godfather).  So, watch out, with Captain Lavender's special powers, that guy who you thought was your faithful mafia friend may now be a townie;  or that cop might now be a mafioso.\n\nAnd the star of the show\n\nTHE RAT:  He belongs to both mafias, but holds no allegiance.  On every third day, he will reveal one mafia member to the game master,  the game master will then reveal that mafia member to Agent 7.  On that third day, Agent 7 will not be allowed to investigate anyone as he is given a freebie.  If THE RAT should survive the annihalation of both Mafias, he then works on his own and will proceed to attempt the wholesale slaughter of the entire town.\n\nAnd of course:\n\nThe Townies -- the regular everyday people who just want to survive and vote out the evil mafia members who are trying to kill them off.\n\nThe setting will be:\n\nThe City of Dugufubuwat "], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.202746"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.202746"]]

He was careful to avoid any mention of Dafagabawat, due to the utter nihilism of the event.\n\nSoon, the drastic measure was on everyone’s lips.  Ninja and Pirate killings were constantly on the minds of everyday townies.  The idea was soon adopted by Rio’s mayor, but with a caveat.\n\n“We certainly cannot proceed in this fashion without some kind of safeguarding!  The idea of killing citizens off daily without some sort of trial is unfathomable.  So, as a compromise, I have randomly chosen a defense attorney and judge.  Should either of them die, they will then choose their successor; should the successor die, he will again choose who shall follow his footsteps.  We can only pray that these jobs do not fall in the wrong hands!”\n\nThe Rules:\n\nEveryday each townsperson is allowed to vote for whomever he believes is either a Pirate or a Ninja.  Since all roles remain anonymous, Pirates and Ninjas will vote along with the townies.\n\nIf a player does not vote within a two day time-frame, that person shall be considered deceased.  However, if a player contacts the game-master to say that he will be gone for more than two days for whatever reason, then the player will be granted leave without penalty.\n\nPirates and Ninjas will have kills on alternating days (Pirates odd days Ninjas even days—these are not based on calendar numbers, but rather on game days, i.e. day 1 is odd, day 2 is even).  The only ones who may contact the game-master with the kill will be the head of either group.  The heads of the Pirates and Ninjas are Sweet Pete and Storm Snake respectively.  Each faction will have four members, the head and three henchmen.\n\nNow, without further ado, I present to you the:\n\nDramatis Personae\n\nPirates – Odd Days\n\nHeaded by the fearsome Sweet Pete, Pirate of the Jungle, this scruffy band makes the town’s lives a living hell by looting and pillaging.  Somehow, though, they rarely get caught and the town simply can’t distinguish between them, the Ninjas, nor themselves.  This very well may have something to do with the town’s cultural diversity.\n\n\nNinjas – Even Days\n\nSome consider these men to be the greater foes of the town.  Despite their leader’s name, Storm Snake, being widely known, all else about them remains a mystery.  They hold no love for either Pirate or Townsfolk and kill indiscriminately.  They’re shady, stealthy, and totally sweet.  \n\nSenhor Policia – The head of the Detective Unit of Rio de Setembro (DUR), he runs a nightly investigation on each town member.  Due to the relatively unsophisticated computer system of the town, he can only get information on one townsperson each night.  Unfortunately, due to the strict laws preventing any actual police work, he cannot act upon any of his investigations by killing anyone.  Also, the Mafia leaders (godfathers) are invisible to Senhor Policia as they are experts at hiding in plain sight.\n\nPiranha – This saucy maiden is quite beguiling.  She’s exceedingly wealthy, yet has never held an actual job.  How she makes her money is quite a mystery, but it may have something to do with her connections with the town’s elite and her nightly parties.\n\nIwamatsu the Ronin – This samurai immigrated to Rio to escape his violent past.  But the Ninjas have brought dishonor to his culture.  He has decided to take up arms each night and do battle against them.  But, he has sworn to himself, should he kill an innocent, he will perform seppuku. \n\nBlue Bangs – A former pirate, his gang was destroyed by Sweet Pete’s rotten bunch.  He holed up with a former Ninja master and has learned the ways of Ninjutsu, making him the first ever Ninja Pirate.  His guiding light is burning hatred.  Every night he may kill off any person he chooses.\n\nTHE COURT SYSTEM\n\nThe Townies act as the Prosecutor by voting up one man whose fate will be decided by:\n\nPhoenix Wright – Defense Attorney\n\nThis man was specially picked by the mayor.  Each night he has to decide whether or not to defend the man chosen to be prosecuted.  If he refuses, the chosen dies, if he accepts then the final decision goes to:\n\nJudge Wapner\n\nWhen Phoenix decides to defend a townie, he makes the Guilty or Not Guilty call.\n\nAnyone who is on the docket cannot be killed that night as he is under protection of the jail guards.\n\nIMPORTANT – THESE ROLES WILL BE PASSED ON SHOULD THEY DIE.   THE PERSON WHO HOLDS THESE ROLES WILL CHOOSE HIS SUCCESSOR.  WHEN THERE ARE FIVE OR FEWER TOWNIES, THESE POSITIONS WILL BE LIQUIDATED.\n\nAnd of course The Good People of Rio de Setembro."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.205993"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.205993"]]

Two factions have formed and each has everything to lose and everything to gain by either losing or winning the war.  \n\nBoth sides have come upon new technologies that could finally devestate the other and have hired operatives specialized in infiltration.\n\nThese nations are:\n\nThe Confederation of Wii\n\nand \n\nSonyfornia\n\n\nThe poor citizens have suffered long enough and wish to return to the peace and prosperity they once shared.  But millions had already chosen sides long before the first shot was fired.  Righteous, misguided anger seems to poison the very air that everyone breaths.  But a  few citizens have had enough and have decided to take the war to The Confederation and Sonyfornia and stop them both.\n\nThe roles include:\n\nThe Confederation Spys:  Two men headed by a leader, Moto.  They plan on releasing a virus that will destroy the very foundation of Sonyfornia's massive army.  Moto is completely invisible to the Citizen's Emissary.  They have one kill on odd days.  Moto must assign a henchman to each killing.\n\nSonyfornia Spec Ops:  Two men headed by a leader, Kurt.  They plan on intercepting the Spys and send recon info back to base so the Sonyfornian Chief General can crush the Confederation with their massive weaponry.  Kurt is invisible to the Citizen's Emissary.  They have one kill on even days.  Kurt must assign a henchman to each killing.\n\nBill -  He is a wealthy citizen who plans on destroying both sides on his own terms.  But in order to do so he needs to form a powerful team.  Each night he looks to recruit the right man for the job.  His hope is to find...\n\nPeter - A charismatic man who knows how to pull a team together.  If Bill finds him, he will automaticaly recruit...\n\nJ - A computer hacker of devestating ability.  He has sided with the citizens, but has become more militant in his desire to destroy both companies.  Joining up with Bill and Peter is right up his alley.\n\nTogether, the three form the X-Team.  If they form, they will have one kill each night.  Citizen fighters are simply collatoral damage.  They are all invisible to the Citizen's Emissary unless they have formed together.  At which point none of them have the immunity of Kurt or Moto.  Bill will assign the henchman for each killing.\n\nCitzen's Emissary -  Working for the citizens, the emissary is a man of incredible stealth and intelligence, he has the ability to either investigate or kill each night.  He works side by side with. . .\n\nThe Emissary's Deputy - He has the ability to protect someone each night.  Anyone he protects is not only untouchable by the three groups, but also immune to being voted out the next day by the Citizens.  The deputy, however, cannot protect the Emissary.\n\nThe Defenders of the Keep - These three are a group of citizens who set up ingenious obstacles.  They can prevent one person from being killed each night.  Not only that, but if they successfully block a target, the group cannot make another strike that night.  So, if the Confederation should make a hit on Mr. X, and he is protected by the Defenders, then that night they go without a kill.\n\nThe Downtrodden Man - This is a man who has lost all hope for the future.  He plans on the night of the third day to strike out and kill two people with him.  If he succeeds in killing at least one member of the three fighting factions, he will live to strike one more time on day five.  If this man is voted out, he will take out the last person who votes for him.  If any of the assigned henchmen kill the DM, he dies. If the Emissary kills the DM, the DM gets to pick one other person to die with him. If the last person to vote for the DM is protected by the Emissary's assistant, then he will not die.  If a Mafia member is protected and kills the DM, then he will not die.  These are the only ways to kill the DM without casualties.\n\nThe Citizens - Unkown to eachother, they hope to rid themselves of both factions and start a new government of peace.\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.224394"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.224394"]]

Why did she get up early again?  Oh yeah!  She knew it was supposed to rain today, the best time to hook an elusive Coelacanth.  After cramming her fishing pole into her dress, she made her way outside.  As the news had forecasted, a steady rain was falling.  Pulling out her stylish umbrella, she skipped merrily down to the beach.  Once there, she started walking as to avoid scaring away her unsuspecting prey.  A shadow!  She cast her line in the direction the shadow was looking.  The fish then turned and swam the other direction!  \"Augh!,\" she murmured, as she cast her line again....and again...and again...Finally she hooked the fish!  \"A SEABASS?

She caught another sea bass, and another...and another...\"Where are all the good fish!?,\" she cried out in disgust.  Then a unusually large shadow caught her eye.

I am the Mayor of Beanerville, Mayor Aurion.  As you can see, Beanerville isn't exactly your usual, friendly Animal Crossing town.  Rather, we've pulled in some dark individuals that thrive on ambition and deceit...And I don't just mean the usual \"tree choppers.\"  It's not a secret that the local monopolizing raccoon, Tom Nook, and his trusty \"Crooked Cranny 'Coons\" are at war with Black Market veteran Crazy Redd; bodies are found all the time!  And if that were bad enough, I've been receiving suicide bomb threats for the past few weeks!  But no matter, I've decided enough is enough...All of the villagers will be locked inside the town until this matter is sorted out.  Good luck to all of you...\n\n~Mayor Aurion\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow the prologue is out of the way, let me introduce you to the roles of the game!\n\nMayor Aurion - That's me, your loving grandfather figure!  I'll be monitoring your progress and tallying your votes...\n\nCrooked Cranny 'Coons - The \"top dog\" gang in town...The Godfather, Tom Nook, has been monopolizing the market for years.  Because they don't know the members of the Black Market Foxes, they will take out everyone in the town with them, but only on odd days...(Tom Nook's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nBlack Market Foxes - The Godfather of this gang, Crazy Redd, decided to take advantage of Tom Nook's price gouging monopoly a few months back, and has been undercutting the prices of all of Nook's goods (legal and not-so legal) ever since...Like the 'Coons, they wish to get rid of their enemy as soon as possible...They will make hits on even days...(Crazy Redd's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nDetective Copper - our local cop has taken it upon himself to locate the members of each gang and bring them to justice.  Being the perfectionist he is, he only investigates the identity of one town member each night.\n\nMint - This spunky squirrel gets around town faster than anyone, and if you've played Animal Crossing, you know just how fast it is to get around town...With her powers of \"persuasion,\" she is able to sway a close vote in the direction she desires every night...\n\nBlanca - A mysterious foreigner made her way into town before the gates were closed.  She can steal the face of a single person at any point in the game (overnight), killing the original owner of the role in the process...If Blanca ends up wishing to kill someone who is being targetted by Death or Mafia, Blanca will reach the victim first...If Blanca kills Cube, she will die...\n\nK.K. Slider - The local guitar-strumming legend is also an ally of justice...Upset at the general lack of motivation of the Villagers in tracking down the scum of Beanerville, he's become a vigilante...He has enough time to plan one attack on a single person every night, but if kills an innocent his life is forfeit...\n\nDeath AKA Mr. Resetti - Who we believe to be a very strict anti-reset mole is actually a messenger from above...He can leave his hole every night to kill one person of his choice...However, if he kills Sable, he will forfeit his position in this world as well...EDIT: I forgot to note that Detective Copper sees Death as a Villager as well...\n\nGuardian Angel AKA Sable - The calm seamstress is the second messenger sent from the other side...She knows the intentions of Death every night, and can protect a single person from Death's touch over the course of the game...otherwise, she can protect one person a night...I guess it's also important to note that Detective Copper is not a medium (one who can see ghosts), and thus Sable's identity to him is \"Villager\"...\n\nCube the Suicide Penguin - This crazy penguin is the most dangerous character of the game, and there is no reasoning for his threats...\n- can choose 2 people to kill on one night, but he also dies\n- if he is killed over-night, the person that killed him also dies\n- if he is voted off, all of those who voted for him will die\n\nBomber's Apprentice - Unfortunately, Cube has taken in an apprentice...When or if Cube dies, his protege will take over the role of Suicide Bomber...It is also important to note that the Apprentice could be ANYONE in the game, even if they already have a role...If the Apprentice has another role, their other role will be their identity if they are investigated...\n\nVillagers - Innocent townies who just want to live the rest of their lives fishing, gardening, and insect catching in peace..."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.233855"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.233855"]]

After beating on a defenseless Pidgey for a while, they stuffed it in a tiny ball and took it home.  “Wow!” thought his friends, “How fun is that?!”  A nearby Rattata heard this and sensed the impending doom.  It ran out to the woods to warn the other Pokemon.\n\nThey couldn't stop the onslaught of greedy kids.  The term “Gotta catch 'em all” haunted their dreams.  A Pokemon's purpose was now to fight with other Pokemon.  The humans had opened Pandora's Box.  Something snapped inside many of the creatures.  Some craved power.  Others craved intelligence.  Some craved the happiness they once had.\n\nTwo opposing groups intended to use fear to achieve their goals.  Pokemon were either with them or against them.  If they were against them, they were as good as dead in their minds.\n\nThe leader of one group pictured himself snapping the necks of anyone who got in his way.  He called his crew “Snap.”\n\nThe other group couldn't think of a good name.  The leader thought, “Wouldn't it be cool if we just stuck two random letters together?”  From that point on, they were known as “XD”.\n\nA third group of Pokemon were sick of what their nice little community had become.  They felt that all Pokemon, including themselves, should be dead.  Their power was too great.  The problem is, this particular group of Pokemon weren't really good at anything.  Even suicide missions were often a bit too tough and ended up in failure.  Oh sure, their target would die, but they, themselves would often walk away unscathed.  Looking at how much they sucked at what they did, the only name that came to their head was “Dash.”\n\nThe rest of the Pokemon just wanted all this internal violence to end.  They put forth a system of voting that would eliminate a bad monster every night.  The problem is, the bad monsters got to vote too and none of the Pokemon were willing to trust each other, so they didn't even know who their comrades were.\n\n\nHard rules.\nSnap – Every third night is an action night starting with the first night.\nXD – Every third night is an action night starting with the second night.\nDash – Every third night is an action night starting with the third night.\n\nIf any of these teams are eliminated their action nights remain the same.  Therefore it is in the townies best interests to get rid of an entire team as fast as possible.\n\nThere are many special roles in this game.  They are being intentionally withheld to hopefully make things more interesting.\n\nNothing in this game is a sure thing.  Every possible action has probabilities associated with it.  You will have to trust me to treat these probabilities with respect and I will never reveal the hard numbers.\n\nSome minor exceptions to this rule.\nDash will (almost) always have a successful kill if they order it.  The probability comes in when seeing whether or not they are fully 'successful' and die along with their target.  They are really bad at what they do.\n\nIf a member of Dash is killed in any way, the player who kills them will (almost) ALWAYS die.  After a vote, one player will be selected at random to carry out the kill FROM ALL OF THE PLAYERS!  Even if you don't vote for the person who ends up with the most votes, you may still be chosen to carry out the kill.\n\nVictory Conditions:\nMember of Snap:  At the end of the game only Snap members remain.  Even if you died during the game, you will still be declared a winner if this holds true.\n\nMember of XD:  Same as Snap only with XD members.\n\nMember of Dash:  Everyone must die.  If only Dash members remain you will hold a glorious suicide ritual and each member of Dash, even the dead, will be declared winners.\n\nTownies:  You must survive the entire game to the point where no Snap, XD, or Dash members are left.  If you die, you can not be declared a winner.\n\nYou cannot willfully jump sides like I attempted in Mafia V.

Marge was at the grocery store with Maggie, when suddenly, the ground began to shake.  She ran outside to see what was the matter, as the ground began to heave more and more violently.  Suddenly, the Power Plant that had so long been on the horizon exploded in a great mushroom cloud, and much of the town was destroyed by either the quakes, or the explosion.  Letting out a bloodcurdling scream of horror, Marge ran home to check on Bart and Lisa, and to try to find out the fate of her dear Homer.\n\n   There were two groups of survivors from the explosion of the power plant:\n\n---Mr. Burns was among the survivors, when the explosion occurred he was sitting in his mansion, discussing with his Blood Sucking lawyers how to legally sell the organs of workers who died in accidents.  In an Ironic twist, the plant exploded just before they managed work that into the contracts of all of the employees.  Burns was furious not only because he lost the plant, but also, all the employees died before he could harvest their organs.  Burns believed the accident was due to the incompetence of the workers, namely the plant’s safety inspector, Homer Simpson.  Burns and his lawyers will exact their revenge on even numbered nights.\n\n---Oddly enough Homer and some of his buddies were also among the survivors, they were out getting hot dogs when the explosion occurred.  Homer’s scream of D’OH was so loud that they heard it in Shelbyville.  Upset that all of their friends in the plant had died, Homer blamed Mr. Burns for buying cheap, poorly built parts.  Homer and his crew will exact their revenge on Mr. Burns on odd numbered days.\n\n               -Godfathers come up as innocents, if they are inspected\n   -Unless they are the only person left, godfathers must send a henchman to make their kill.  So they need  to pm me the victim and who is going to make the hit.\n\n   While much of the town was destroyed, there are still plenty of people around to sort this whole mess out.\n\n---Mayor Quimby: Me, In light of this tragic event, I have decided to gather the whole town in the town hall, so that we can take care of the mafia.\n\n---My Mistress:  She has some influence over me (because of her huge magumbos).  If there is a tie, she decides who is killed.  If my mistress is killed, I will just have to go to my room, flip a coin, and weep for all of the registered voters who have died.\n\n---Wayland Smithers was chewing food for Mr. Burns at the time of the explosion, his attachment to Mr. Burns is so strong that, should Mr. Burns be killed, Smithers will go on a murderous rampage, and take the lives of 2 Springfielders the next day.\n\n---Marge Simpson: Hell hath no fury like a woman’s scorn.  Should Homer die, in her anguish, Marge will kill 2 people the next day.\n\n---Bart and Lisa Simpson have decided to help the people, and will protect one person each night.  If both are alive, they must agree on who to protect  (So they must BOTH PM me).  Whomever they protect is also immune from the vote the next day.  I will not tell who they are protecting, so if the person whom they are protecting is voted out, then nothing happens.  Also, if their protectee is attacked, the attacker dies along with one of the two simpsons (I flip a coin to decide which one)\n\n---Maggie Simpson:  Suck Suck…….Suck Suck……Suck Suck…….Oh, and she kills one person a night.\n\n---Krusty: has the ability to distract Maggie, Bart, and Lisa, and prevent their actions.  However, he can only distract each child once.  So he can stop Maggie once, and he can stop Bart and Lisa twice (once for Bart, and once for Lisa).\n\n---Moe Syzlak:  Owner of the bar, Moe has connections from the people who get drunk in his bar.  Every night he has the ability to get any one person to tell them what their target is.\n\n---Barney Gumble: armed with his explosive belching, and bombs made out of Duff bottles, Barney has decided to end his own life, and he wants to take as many people out with him as possible:\n   -kill two people on one night (as well as himself)\n   -If he is voted out, all who vote for him die\n   -If he is attacked, the attacker who makes the hit dies with him.\n\n---Patty and Selma:  Because no one can actually see them, due to the incredible amount of tobacco smoke, they can kill once during the game, and take their victim’s place.  Like Bart and Lisa they must agree on their actions and both PM me.  Example, they must both agree on who to replace, and should they take the place of a godfather, they must both agree on their assassinations.  Also, since they are always together, should one die, the other one dies as well.\n\n---Police Chief Wiggum has decided to figure this whole thing out, so he gets to investigate one person a night, however, since he has such stubby legs, he can’t catch anyone, and is unable to make any kills.\n\n---Ned Flanders:  Has taken it upon himself to end the sin in the town, with a cross on his chest, and the power of God on his side, he seeks to send the evildoers to hell didely ell with one kill every night.  Should he kill an innocent, he will take his own life.\n   *special notes about flanders*\n   -Marge and Smithers are guilty because it is in the townies best interest to kill them before a godfather.\n   -Patty and Selma are innocent until they make their kill, then it depends on whose role they take.\n   -Bart and Lisa, Krusty, and Moe are innocent.\n   -Maggie is guilty, even though it is a shame to kill a baby.  I know it does not sound right for flanders to kill her, but I willl explain should the situation come up\n   \n---Townies:  They all just want to sort out this whole mess so that they can put this tragedy behind them, and get on with their lives.\n\nVOTE QUIMBY…..WAIT, don’t vote quimby!\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.240641"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.240641"]]

Mad Gear controls major criminal activity in the city. When they learned of Haggar's plans, they took immediate action to bring this new mayor under their control.\n\nIn 1989.\n\n\n\nHaggar:  Hello?  Mike Haggar here.\nPhone:  Hee hee hee, Mr. Haggar.  So pleased to make your acquaintance.  I believe you know who I am!  Don't hang up!  We have a little business proposition for you...  Your INTERNET FORUM for your cooperation.  And we'll throw in the regular monthly bonus \nto your salary we offered before.\nHaggar:  What?!  What happened to MIKE'S FUNHOUSE?? Who is this?!\nPhone:  Not so fast, Mike.  Turn on your TV.\n(Haggar turns on the TV.  On the screen is the Mad Gear gang trolling his personal forum!)\nHaggar:  You fiend! \nPhone:  Nothing yet...but we will if you don't cooperate.  Listen to reason.  Why make your job difficult? Just let us do as we please like the mayor before you did!\n\n\nMEANWHILE:\nCody:  What?!  Mike's Forum?! TROLLED!?\nGuy:  What's a forum?\nCody:  It's on the internet.  The Mad Gears must pay!\nGuy:  What a dirty trick!  I will help you out.\nCody: You go ahead while I try to lose this crazy transexual.\n\n\n\nLATER:\nDean: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor! The city is under attack by the SKULL CROSS GANG!\nHaggar: What?!\nDean: Wait a minute Mr. Mayor. I can lead you to them. \nHaggar: Who the heck are you?! \nDean: Does it really matter?! All you need to know is that I know where they're headed.\nMike Haggar: I haven't got a choice so I'll trust you.  But if you're leading me into a trap, I'm gonna grind you into the pavement. Let's hit the streets!! \n\nIf this is your first time playing mafia, this is a game detective work, suspicion, and double-crossing. Good guys try to vote out the gangs, and the gangs try to take out all of the other players. It's fun and easy!\n\nROLE INTRODUCTIONS:\nThe Heroes\n Mayor Mike Haggar will clean up the streets by wailing on people with a giant pipe, pretty much. He's addicted to the internet, though, so he'll only go out and wail on someone when he feels like - the classic vigilante role. His term as mayor will be over if he takes out anybody but a gangster, though! Even the serial killer, this time!\n\n Guy can use his ninja clan connections and stealth to investigate all but the top gang leaders every night. The classic cop role.\n\n Cody loves to punch guys and get into trouble. If he's voted out, he can escape from jail; he's a good guy, but he's a jailbreaker. The catch is, if that happens, everyone will obviously know his identity. Many other roles revolve around Cody in some way, too.\n\nPublic Nuisances - Some are good guys, some are just jerks\n Two-P has a choice of joining Mad Gear, giving them an extra member, or joining Cody as a townie (they will then know each other and be able to work together in votes or whatever). If investigated, only the role will be discovered, but not which side they have joined.\n\n Dean gets the same deal, except with the Skull Cross gang. If both Two-P and Dean side with Cody, that's quite a group to start with, but maybe being in a mafia is safer. Or is it?\n\n Poison, the ultra hot gangster slut, has a big surprise! She can, scratch that, will seduce a vote out of anyone she wants, daily, but only to Cody, because she wants him all to herself for some hot conjugal visits. If she doesn't report in with which vote she wants to change, a vote from the highest non-tie creating bloc will be changed to Cody. She can still help the townies a bit through clever vote manipulation and is on the townie's side, basically. If Cody is taken out of the game, she'll revert to the classic town whore role.\n\n Roxy, Poison's close friend and palette swap, is a normal town whore role.\n\n Rolento is a jerk that blows guys up with grenades. As the classic suicide bomber, he can blow up two people and himself whenever he feels like it. Or everybody that votes for him if he's voted out. Or the bottom-ranked member of the gang that takes him out. Watch out for El Gado, though.\n\n El Gado lives for revenge against Rolento. He will serial kill people every other night without consequence until Rolento is dead. When Rolento dies, he becomes a townie and loses his ability to kill people. He can win with the townies... or by himself. He's the only guy that can kill Rolento without being blown up.\n\n The Barrel contains a delicious roast that will restore a player to a vacant role at the whim of the Barrel, even if the barrel has already been taken out. It's a magic barrel that is also registered to vote.\n\n Sodom, the ultimate wanna-be, can bump off anyone and assume their role.\n\nAnd, of course, an indeterminate number of townies.\n\nThe Gangsters\nMad Gear:\n Belger is the leader of Mad Gear and will be shown as a townie to investigators.\n Edi.E is the #2 Mad Gear goon in this game, and can investigate a player every night.\n MG Goon is the 3rd rank Mad Gear gangster, or 4th if Two-P joins.\n\nSkull Cross:\n Black is the leader of Skull Cross and will be shown as a townie to alligators.

In the game of Mafia, there are basically two sides. Innocents known as townies and Bad guys known as Mafia. The game is played over a course of days. Each day, everybody can vote for one person to be eliminated from the game. The person with the highest amount of votes is the one eliminated. The townies are trying to vote out the mafia while the mafia is trying to vote out the townies. This is not as easy as it sounds. The mafia have an advantage by knowing who all their members are, while the townies don't know who else is innocent besides themselves. The mafia also has another advantage by the fact that they can make a hit every night. The next day, the person who was voted out is killed in a little story and their role revealed. The person who the mafia hit is also killed and their role mentioned in the story as well.\n\nVote Rules\n\nTo vote, simply type in bold: VOTE (NAME) You may post anything else you want during the day or with that message. You can only vote for one person. If you wish to change your vote, make sure to erase the old vote. Only votes that are in bold will be counted. If you have two votes, neither will count. \n\nYou must vote at least once every two days. Failure to vote will result in death. If you have a reason for not voting in time, PM me before the third day of abscence to let me know. \n\nTies\n\nIf there is a tie at the deadline, there is a simple procedure for solving it. Anyone who has not voted that day has 10 minutes after the dead line to vote for one of the people tied up. If after 10 minutes, there is still a tie, anyone who didn't vote that day will be killed instead. So if there were 4 people who didn't vote, I'd randomly select one to die instead. Maybe 2 if I'm cranky. But what if everyone voted and there was still a tie. Then, there will be the 10 minute delay to change one's vote for someone else. If after the 10 minutes, there is still a tie, then those who are tied will be exempt and I will randomly select someone else to die. Should have saved yourself.\n\nTo Win\n\nFor the townies to win, every mafia member must be killed and only innocent townies remain.\n\nFor the mafia to win, they only have to get to the point where it is equal townies and mafia. Example, 3 townies left and 3 mafia members left. At that point, it is assumed the mafia take over.\n\nNote: there are also different roles with a different win condition. Example, Suicide Bomber's win is to kill everyone. Also, if there are 3 mafia but 2 townies and the suicide bomber, the game does not end as the bomber could wipe out the mafia's advantage. The reverse is true also. If all mafia are voted out but the bomber is still alive, townies have not won yet as the bomber may have a chance to kill them all.\n\nFor all roles that don't belong in one of the two groups of mafia or townie, they are considered a faction of their own and will have a different win condition listed.\n\nThe Roles\n\nMafia\n\nIn this game of mafia, we are starting out with only one mafia. However, if I feel a substantial amount of people have joined, I will add a second mafia. The second mafia will have the same roles as this one.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nThis is the head of the mafia. He is the one who ultimately decides who gets whacked each night. On the mafia's action night, he will send me the name of the person he chooses to have killed.\n\nThe Mafia Spy\n\nAnother mafia member. He has the ability to investigate any person to see what their role is. On the mafia's action night, he sends me the name of the person he wants investigated and I send him their role.\n\nThe Mafia Recruiter\n\nA third mafia member. He has the ability to recruit people to join the mafia. However, his ability is limited. On the mafia's action night, he will send me the name of the person he wishes to have join the mafia. He will also choose a number between 1 and 6. Then, I will roll a dice. If the number matches, it's a succesful recruitment. If not, the recruitment fails. Also, the person who is being recruited does not know any of this unless the recruitment is succesful. They will then be sent a PM, letting them know they are now mafia.\n\nThe Mafia Doctor\n\nOur fourth mafia member. The doctor has the ability to protect any one he chooses, except himself. There is one catch, however. The doctor can not use his ability until the townie doctor is killed. As long as the townie doctor is alive, the mafia doctor can not forge his credentials and start practicing medicine. Once he has his ability, each night, he will send me the name of the person he is protecting.\n\nThe Mafia Propagandist\n\nA new role for the mafia. The propagandist has two abilites. Before the game begins, he will give me the name of one person he wants corrupted. This person can be anyone from the bomber to the cop to a rival mafia member if we add another mafia. This corrupted person effectively becomes another mafia member, swayed by propaganda. The propagandist can also tell the corrupted townie how to vote. The other ability the propagandist has is being able to cancel one person's vote each night. The propagandist will send me a PM of the person who's vote he wants cancelled.\n\nThe Corrupted Townie\n\nOur final mafia member. The corrupted townie could be anyone. What's worse is that no one can know he's corrupted. If he is investigted, he will only register as a normal townie or any other role he might have. The corrupted townie only listens to the Propagandist, however and votes according to his wishes. If the propagandist is killed, the corrupted townie has a choice. Stay with the mafia or join the townies again. If he joins the townies, this action will be revealed in the story the next day. He is free to reveal anything he may know. If he stays with the mafia, he will then learn who all the mafia consists of if he doesn't know yet and he is free to vote how he wants, no longer controlled by the propagandist.\n\nFinal notes for Mafia Members\n\nNew Godfathers\n\nThe mafia has the ability to choose a new godfather any day. \n\nTo do so, all members must PM me saying they want a new godfather. They must also give me the name of the person they want to see as the new godfather. The corrupted townie can not vote, however anyone succesfully recruited can. Also the corrupted townie does not need to send a PM asking for a new godfather. \n\nThe new godfather will be the person with the most votes and the old godfather will be killed. If there is a tie, 2-2, then no one becomes godfather but the old godfather will still be killed. This means the mafia must solve their differences and elect a new godfather fast, otherwise they will make no kills. \n\nAlso, when making a succesful coup, I will only PM the new godfather, informing him of his extra role. I will not give the voting record nor will I PM the other mafia members letting them know who is the new godfather. That is the new godfather's responsibility. This means in a tie, I will not PM anyone. You will have to figure that out yourselves and revote.\n\nThe Mole.\n\nWhy would you vote your godfather? He might be the mole. \n\nThe mole is another new role. At the end of Day 2, I will randomly select one mafia member to become the mole except for the corrupted townie. The mole is a member of the mafia, working against the mafia. How does it work? \n\nThe mole will PM with a message. This message will contain the name of a mafia member and their role. It's the mole's choice who. The mole will also give me the name of the person he would like to send this information too. Then, I will PM that person with a package. The package will be the info the mole gave me. The mafia member's name and role. The person who recieves the package will only know it was given to him be the mole's role, i.e. Godfather, Spy, Doctor, etc. \n\nThis is significant because if that person ends up being recruited, he will know who the mole is. The mole must also be careful not to hit the townie idiot. The townie idiot will post the entire contents of the package including the mole's role. \n\n\nThe Townies\n\nThe Doctor\n\nThe doctor can protect anyone he wants, except himself. Before the day begins, he can PM me with a name if he wants or he can wait until the evening and PM me. Why wait? Well, if the doctor wants, he can save the person with the most votes. Then the person with the next amount of votes will be killed instead. If the doctor is corrupted, he will do the bidding of the propagandist and use his role as the propagandist wants. If he is recruited, he is free to protect who he wants. Of course, he will be working for the mafia in these cases. Also, if he is recruited or corrupted, the mafia doctor may begin practicing medicine. Neither doctor can protect the other.\n\nThe Cop\n\nThe cop is working for the townies and may investigate one person each night. He can see all roles except for the corrupted townie or the mole. And, like usual, the Godfather will show up as a townie. If the cop is corrupted, he'll do as the propagandist wants. If he's recruited, he uses his power for the mafia.\n\nThe Townie Idiot\n\nThe townie idiot is a drunk who can't keep anything to himself. Any information he is given will be revealed, except for his role, strangely enough. The townie idiot is playing for the townies but he it can be hard tell. What does this mean? If the townie idiot is corrupted, he will tell eveyone he's corrupted and who corrupted him. If he's recruited, he becomes the mafia idiot and starts naming names. Consider him a whammy.\n\nThe Drifter\n\nI don't think I have ever seen this role used once. So, let's give it one more shot. The drifter has the ability to take over anyone's role. He just PM's me the name of the person he wants to become. That person is killed. Their role, whatever it may be, becomes the drifter's. Here's some added value to the role. If he's corrupted, he could take over the godfather role. Then the godfather would be in the hands of the propagandist. However, taking over a mafia role means he would stay mafia if the propagandist was killed. If he's recruited, he can take over anyone's role in the mafia if he wants. However, if uses his role and gets a different role outside of the mafia after being recruited, he still stay mafia.\n\nThe Magician\n\nThe magician is a new role. The magician can change the roles of anyone every night. How does that work? Each night, the magician PM's me the names of two people. I then will PM those people and inform them of their new role. There are some things to keep in mind. The magician never knows if the action was a success. No one else knows who has switched roles except for the librarian. Also, certain roles can not be switched. A mafia member can not switch roles with a townie. However, if two mafia members were selected, they could switch roles because they are in the same mafia. The mole role will never be switched. The corrupt townie could be switched. That spells trouble for the propagandist. The librarian role can not be switched. Yes, the magician can also use his name for switching roles and give his role to someone else.\n\nThe Librarian\n\nKnowlegde is power. The librarian must figure out how to use that power correctly. The librarian will learn a ratio of people's roles. Say 30 people are playing, the librarian can the learn the roles of about 7 others. How does this work? Well, the librarian can ask to learn the roles for whoever he choses up to a limit, in this example, up to 7 people. The librarian can ask for this information before the game begins or any time thereafter. Nor does the librarian have to ask for all 7 choices right away. The librarian could chose to wait and learn about a person anytime they wished. Moreover, anyone the librarian asks about, that person's role will always be revealed. So, if someone is recruited or corrupted, the librarian will know this. If their role is switched the librarian will learn the new role but not who got the switched role unless that person is also on the librarian's list. The librarian can also learn who the mole is if that person is on the librarian's list. Obviously then, the librarian would be desired by the mafia. However, if the librarian is blabbermouth or unable to use this knowledge well, the librarian may soon be taking a dirtnap. Of course, corrupted, the librarian would do the propagandist's bidding. Recruited, the librarian aids the mafia.\n\nThe Bounty Hunter\n\nThe bounty hunter is out to rid the world of the mafia. He'll do it both the honest way (voting with everyone) and his own way (killing them himself). Yes, the bounty hunter fills the vigilante role. Each night, he can PM me the name of a person he wants killed. The catch is the person must be a mafia member. If he kills an innocent, he dies along with the innocent. If the bounty hunter is corrupted, he'll kill whoever the propagandist wants. But, the bounty hunter can not be recruited. He would kill himself and the recruiter before will joining a mafia. Brainwashing is different.\n\nNon-Townie Roles\n\nThe Suicide Bomber\n\nYes, the bomber is back. New and improved. The bombeer may at any time, choose 3 people to blow up and die with him. If he is voted out, everyone who voted for him will be blown up. If a mafia hits him, two mafia members die: The godfather and another mafia member of the godfather's choosing. More than that, every two days that the suicide bomber lives, he plants explosives on someone else. Only I and the bomber know who else would be a walking time bomb. The librarian can know if that person is one on their list. The bomber has no rational except to see everyone die. As for the walking time bomb, if they are voted out, the suicide bomber can choose two people who voted for the time bomb to be killed with the time bomb. If corrupted, the bomber doesn't neccassarily do the propagandist's bidding. Because he is irrational, he still shows independence and does what he wants. If recruited, the bomber still does as he wants. If he wants to blow up a part of this mafia, he can. Moreover, the bomber can not win a mafia victory. He can only win by the death of everyone.\n\nThe Killer\n\nThe killer works alone. He is out for himself and himself only. He can only win by being the last one standing. The killer has a small advantage. Because he is an expert at what he does, he is the only one who can safely kill a time bomb or the bomber and not die. He can a make a hit every night against anyone he chooses. If he is corrupted, he does the propagandist's bidding. If he is recruited, he may win with a mafia victory.\n\n\nThat should be all the roles for now. I'll wait to see how many sign-up before deciding if we need a second mafia or some extra roles. It will sort of be like F-Zero Gx. The more people we get, the more stuff we can unlock. The reason I mention F-Zero GX is because that is the theme of the game!\n\nThe Theme\n\nYes, this mafia game will revolve around F-Zero GX. It was for that reason I gave no names for the roles. You can choose any character you want from F-Zero GX as your persona in the game. Except for Mr. Zero, the announcer. That role will be mine as the narrator. What's that you don't know many F-Zero Characters. Well, Wikipedia has a couple pages of racers for you as well as a brief bio of them. So choose the one that appeals to you and run with it.\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.245001"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.245001"]]

Fox was relaxing on Sauria when he got a distress call from Slippy....\n\nFox quickly shared the news with the rest of the team, and General Peppy.\n\nAnd so Fox, Falco, and Krystal boarded the Great Fox and made their way to the Lonely Hearts Inn, a vacation satellite orbiting Cornaria. Soon after their arrival, the following message was sent:\n\n\"Report to General Peppy from Fox McCloud:\n\nOutside communication has been cut off, but we finally managed to get a message through. We've made it to the Inn, and Slippy and everyone else is okay. But the situation is far worse than we thought - Star Wolf is being lead by Andross, and he's here on the satellite! To make matters worse, he's flooded the corridors with deadly gas. My team, every vacationer, and me are trapped in our individual rooms - the only places that are safe from the gas.\n\nWe're going to try and take care of Andross and Star Wolf - we know they're trapped in their rooms too, so it'll be a piece of cake for ROB to drop bombs on their locations. The only problem is - we've checked the guest list, and they aren't on it. Which means there are four traitors on board who are hiding and protecting the bad guys in their rooms, and we don't know who they are. We suspect that Andross has subjected these traitors, and maybe even Star Wolf, to some form of mind control.\n\nIt isn't all bad, though. Each room is equipped with a powerful Ultra 64 computer, and I can talk with everyone on the satellite over the Ultra 64 network. We've decided that everyone will vote on who the traitors are. Whoever the vacationers decide is a bad guy, will be blown up. It'll be tricky, because the traitors will be able to vote too, and Andross and Star Wolf will be able to monkey around with us as well. But it's our only option. I hope no innocent people are killed.\n\nFox Out.\"\n\nAndross and Star Wolf taunt Fox and company by day, and kill by night.\n\nAndross - BlackNMild. Kills one vacationer ever night. Has the power to make the traitor who is protecting him appear like an innocent vacationer to the investigator. \nWolf O' Donnel - Blackfootsteps.\nLeon Powalski - Mario.\nPanther Caroso - Mystic Gohan. \n\nThe traitors – Loyal to Andross, each one is hiding either Andross or a member of Star Wolf. If a traitor is voted out, both the traitor and the bad guy he is protecting dies.\n\nIf Andross dies, he gets to choose which member of Star Wolf will become the new leader. This person will be capable of killing, but not of making his protector appear innocent. His hold on his followers will not be as strong as Andross’s – if his fellow Star Wolf members, or the traitors, disagree with who he is planning on killing on any given night, they can choose to overrule him. If there are at least two traitors remaining, and every traitor sends in the name of an alternate target, that person will be killed instead. Similarly, if there are at least three members of Star Wolf remaining, the leader’s fellow Star Wolf members can also pick an alternate target (Star Wolf alternate targets trump traitor alternate targets.)\n\nFox McCloud - while better known as a fighter pilot, Fox is also a skilled investigator. He can determine the role of one person each night.\n\nThe Doctor - There is a Cornarian army doctor on board, identity unknown. He can protect one person every night.\n\nAnd finally, there are the innocent vacationers.\n\nThe Ultra 64 network is divided into three sections, or \"threads\":\n\n-Open Channel: Discuss goings-on here.\n-Voting Booth: Vote for who you suspect here.\n-ROB's Updates: See the results of votes, who the bad guys have killed, etc., here.\n\nEvery day, you vote for who you suspect is loyal to Andross, in the \"Voting Booth\" thread. With the exception of Andross and members of Star Wolf, everyone can vote, including people with roles. Every night, the bad guys can kill one person, Fox can investigate one person, and the doctor can protect one person (via pms).\n\nYou can lie, claim whatever you want, and even reveal your role. However, you are not allowed to quote or show screenshots of pms. While alive, you must post in a mafia thread at least once every 2 days (except over the weekend.) While dead, you must not try to influence the outcome of the game in any way. (While there’s obviously no way of monitoring pms, please honor this rule. It’s important because the bad guys will often kill people to hush them up.)\n\nTo win, you have to stay alive. Apart from that, if you’re innocent, all of the Andross loyalists need to be voted out. If you’re not innocent, innocents need to be killed off until the number of innocents is equal to the number of Andross loyalists."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.248011"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.248011"]]

Or just any forum game to play. Well, since it might be awhile yet until 18 Days posts her mafia and because she kept insisting on calling it Mafia 13, I thought that I would step up into the plate and deliver the long-lost mafia 12. The reason that most people do not discuss mafia 12 is because it is a little bit stupid. Hence the fact that it is funhouse mafia. Yes, mafia 12 is designed to be the shortest mafia game ever. \n\nNow, obviously, it has some competition since the shortest mafia game was 11 and that lasted 5 Days. Fortunately, this game will be even shorter. Yes, it will only last three days automatically. It doesn't matter how many people sign up, there will be mass deaths in order to keep this rule in effect. Best of all, sign-up time is real short. You only get two days to sign-up. Sign-up ends Dec.22 at midnight. Then, the game is played in hectic fashion over the next three days. If you found yourself busy during the holidays already, mafia just came and flipped your world upside down. Yes, this just happened.\n\nMore stress? Sign me up! But wait. How do I play? Thanks for asking Billy. The rules are simple. Simply complex. Yes, although the basic will be in place, mafias, cop, doctor, bomber, townies, there will also be a bunch of crazy things given out that just pop into my head. For instance, in every mafia, there will be two godfathers. One is legitimate and makes hits for the mafia. The other is head of a townie base. Both seek the death of the other. However, if a godfather dies, then that mafia can no longer make any hits. Thus, both godfathers will hope to use the other before killing the other one off. Don't backstab too soon! And maybe the mafia's can elect another godfather. It all depends because crazy crap is going to happen all the time.\n\nBelieve it or not, there's a reason for that. The theme is loosely based on Smash Bros. Except that you can choose any Nintendo character from any game. Yes, Smash Bros. with a funhouse twist. Which charater will reign supreme? I can't wait to find out. Since this is my excuse for the shoddy workmanship done on these rules, it gives me an explanation for said crazy crap. It's like items. They just come out of nowhere for no reason. So, for instance, anyone with the letter o in the name is immune from being filled for the next hour. Random vote. Two people are randomly chosen for no reason. After half an hour, the one with the most votes dies. Not around to save yourself? Thought you could watch Identity for awhile? Too bad. And a bunch of other zany and wacky items like that will also appear throughout the game at anytime. Like choosing a new godfather. Thought I'd forgot about that, didn't you. What? You didn't? Uhhh, quick! Look at the next paragraph.\n\nSo, at this point, I don't think there is anything else I need to explain. All roles will be revealed on the day of playing. There are some other things that will happen behind the scenes that might not come out until after the game is over. Yes, after the amount of people complaing about the rules for mafia 10 and saying I made things too complicated, this is my answer. Not complicated enough. Mafia12 will seperate the real Play-uh's from the players. I don't think that made sense. \n\nBut, how could I forget. Voting will be 24 hours, although, things will slow down a lot when I'm not on at night. Ties will be solved the following ways. Both people who are tied in the voting will die but they get to chose one person to take with them. If you die and then talk about a role and reveal info that would help your team. I.e. Mafia member reveals a townie role or townie reveals a mafia role. The team that was hurt by the information gets to immediately kill 3 people of their choosing in retalition. That should settle everything.\n\nSo, all that's left is for everyone to start flooding the sign-up thread. I hope I made it big enough. If you don't choose a character, one will randomly be assigned to you. Also, I sure as heck ain't makin' no avatars for this game. It doesn't deserve that much work. However, if you want to make your own, go ahead. Otherwise, just put in your signiture what character you are. That's the best homemade solution for this game.\n\nFinal thoughts: Basically, if you want to survive, just kill anyone and everyone you can, because chances are, they're trying to do the same to you. Plus, if you're still standing at the end, chances are you won. "], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.250054"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.250054"]]

A malicious hacker amoung the NWR population took advantage of the many bugs and security holes in Fusetalk and destroyed the forum! Within hours, Ty uploaded his own laugho anonymas, stripped back version of the board. Turf wars soon broke out on the new forums and different groups emerged, struggling to take control and run this brave new forum.\n\n\n----NWR Staffers----\nStruggling to maintain control of their VERY OWN FORUM, NWR has it's own internal turmoils to take care of due to the latest staff shakeup.\nMafia A\n\nSteven 'WindyMan' Rodriguez\nSteven is mad! He's taken it upon himself to return order to the forum, stripping his shifty fellow staffers of ban powers! Steven is calling the shots and he's suspicious of his fellow staffers. He still commands their respect though and they will follow his orders while he researches their motives in his spare time.\nMafia Godfather, calls all the shots and assigns goons to do the kills. Investigates on non killing nights. Unlike regular Godfathers, will be revealed as a mobster if investigated, but not identified as the Godfather.\n\nMike 'Pale' Gamin\nA new recruit to the NWR staff, Pale is still sympathetic to the cause of his old friends in the forum. With his trusty green bucket hat for disguise he is familiar to all.\nMafia turncoat, free to choose where his alliegence lies. Identified as Mafia by Mafia investigations and as a Townie to the Cop\n\nLoyal Staffers\nJeff 'Deguello' Shirley, Stan 'Pryopizm' Ferguson and Michael 'TYP' Cole\nJust regular mobster goons, loyal to the cause.\n\n\n----Funhouse Residents----\nTaking over the board and having far to great an influence on the site are the poster from the Funhouse. They will berate, troll and flame their opponents till their opponent gives up and leaves forever.\nThe other Mafia\n\n18 Days/RABicle\nWith the Funhouse named after him in April.

He must loyally follow the kil instructions of either godfather but he is free to choose his own loyalty. Is revealed as being the double agent to the Townie Cop but not the Godfathers.\n\n\n----Forum Members----\nThe undifferentiated mass of the forums are the real victims of the power struggle. They long for a return to the tranquility of the old forums where they can happily gloa about DS sales figures and laugh at Sony. Through the power of the ballot, they have their last chance to rid the forum of militant jerks who are trying to run it.\ntownies\n\nPIAC / Dr Zoidberg\nPIAC loves the forums and is one of the most prolific posters in it's history. He also loves women with diarhea and wants to share this interest with the board. Doing so will see him banned and then brought back by a renegade admin as a moderator, unleashing Dr Zoidberg. Dr Zoidberg acts without prejudice, banning and harassing members as much as he likes.\nPIAC is a regular townie until killed. After being killed Dr Zoidberg gets one kill every night and is exempt from voting requirements. Killing Dr Zoidberg is done through the regular procedures.\n\nIan Sane\nIan Sane has been around the block a million times and wont ever shut up.

Every day he will investigate a player. The information he receives will always be wrong. However, Mafia turncoats will be revealed as Mafia to him.\n\nvudu\nA gifted member with an exception lie detector. Through careful study of those close to him, he instinctively learns their true identities.\nTown cop in the most traditional sense.\n\nIceCold\nIceCold had always been well liked and well known on the forum but few knew the meaning behind his Username. Turns out it was a description of his heart. IceCold isn't taking any crap from staff or the funhouse and is after all of them.\nVigilante. In a slight modification, will not take his own life until he kills two innocents.\n\nwandering\nThis self destructive member has just had enough of PGC NWR or whatever it's called, he hates the staff, the other members and himself. \nSuicide Bomber. If he kills himself, he kills more people the earlier in the game, max of 5, minimun of 2. Kills anyone who kills him. If voted out, kills the last two people who voted for him.\n\nInfernal Monkey\nMr popular of Gamingforce is unhappy that he gets no respect at NWR, especially from that animecyberate bloke. He craves power and hopes to get it through taking out that whore 18 Days.\nAssasin. Can only kill 18 Days. If he succedes, takes control of the Funhouse Mafia. If he fails, he dies. The action takes place immediately. If I get the PM halfway through voting, the death will occur then.\n\nBilly Berghammer\nEvery day, Billy's soul is eroded more by the evil of Game Informer. He still cries himself to sleep over the Paper Mario debacle. When he receives word of the anarchy at his old site, he has an epiphany. If he can remove NWR's current leader, he can take back control of his old site and along with it his own happiness.\nAssasin, but can only target Steven Rodriguez\n\nProfessional666\nThis prominant forum member has been known to change people's minds with a barrage of Daisy pics and Ada Wong videos.\nTown Whore, changes one person's vote before the execution.\n\n\nDespite some of the more obtuse roles, it's vanilla flavoured Mafia. NWR Staff strike first, Funhouse investigate first. 12 hour days, 12 hour nights. Days start at 8am New York Time. The result of the vote is final and the player dies immediately, ties result in all tied players dieing.\n\nThere are however a few secret abilities of some roles. None of them are gamebreaking and they'll be explained to whoever get's the role.\nAll roles will be determined randomly, name out of a hat.

I thought about a Kirby theme in honor of TYP butit just didn't seem right. Plus, trivia covers many games. So, in the end I decided to have a theme that encompasses many ganes. And that theme is......\n\nNintendo Villains/Bosses. Yes, choose any Nintendo villain/boss you would like to emulate for this game. I think it will be interesting to see which badguy is the baddest of them of all. I would prefer that a major villain was chosen. i.e. Marx instead if Waddle Dee. (A Kirby reference). But, I know many of you prefer to use the more obscure characters. Regardless, the only criteria will be that everyone chooses or is assigned a Nintendo villain. So, Dr. Robotnik would not work but Bowser would. \n\nRemember, first come, first serve. So grab your favorite villain now.\n\nThe Rules\n\nHow to Play. (If you are familiar with the mafia games already, skip to the gameplay reminders section)\n\nPlaying mafia can be summerized in one word: Survive! As long as you are still alive in the game, chances are you are winning. \n\nOf course, it is a bit more complicated than that. You should remember that there are two sides to a mafia game. You are either a part of the townie side or the mafia side. If you belong to one side, you are looking to eliminate the rival side. How do you kill players.\n\nEveryday there is a vote to choose one person to eliminate from the game. The person with the most votes at the end of the day is killed. Both sides can vote during the day, mafia and townies. However, after the day vote, there is a night action period. During this time, the mafia can send in a hit for whichever person they choose. The townies have no say in the matter. The next day or turn, the townies learn who the mafia killed and the game repeats until one side is left.\n\nThe victory conditions are a bit different for either side. For the townies to win, every mafia member must be eliminated. For the mafia to win, they just need to equal the number of townies left. So, if there are 3 mafia members left and 3 townies, the game is over and the mafia wins. The reason for this is that mafia members are supposed to be so powerful as to overwhelm the townies one-on-one. Obviously, if the townie number is lower than the number of mafia remaining, the mafia wins. A tie is the minimum win condition for the mafia.\n\nIt should be noted that there may be a couple roles that don't fit into either catagory (mafia or townie) and have a different win condition. These roles most also be eliminated before one side can claim victory.\n\nFinally, since it is a prize edition, this should be stated clearly. If the townies won, not every townie would get the prize. Only those townies who are alive at the end of the game would get to claim the prize. It is just the same as any other mafia game where only townies alive at the end get to count a victory. With the mafia, you can count a victory even if you are dead so long as the rest of the mafia is able to win. However, because of the prize being involved, only the mafia members still alive at the end of the game would be eligible for the prize.\n\nVoting Rules\n\nEveryday, a new thread will be created for each day the game lasts. In this thread, you can cast a vote for whomever you want. To do so, simply type in bold \"VOTE (Name)\" where name is the person you are voting for. You can only vote for one person so votes for different people will not be counted. If you wish to change your vote at anytime, simply edit your message and erase the vote. There will be a deadline each day for when votes can be cast. Once the deadline is reached, all votes are binding. If you change or edit a vote after the deadline, the new vote will not be counted and the old vote will remain as your choice instead. \n\nGameplay Reminders\n\nI am going to stick with the long voting hours I introduced in Mafia 10. So, basically, the voting thread will be open for 21-22 hours. This gives everyone in all time zones a fair chance to play.\n\nBreaking voting ties. \n\nIf there is a tie at the end of the day's vote, I will leave the thread open a bit past the deadline for a length of time afterwards. I will list then how much extra time will be given as circumstances may vary for me. No more than half an hour. During this extra time, any player can change their vote if they wish. As well, any player who hadn't voted that day may then cast a vote. The first vote that breaks the tie ends the voting. The person with the most votes will then be killed. \n\nIf however, the remaining time has expired and the vote is still tied, the players who are tied are all killed. However, those players get to choose one person who voted for them to die with them. Thus, you may want to avoid ties.\n\nRevealing someone's role after you are out of the game.\n\nIf you are eliminated and then give away someone's role, (i.e. Mafia member reveals a townie player's identity or townie reveals a mafia player's identity) the team that was hurt by the information gets to immediately kill 3 people of their choosing in retalition. Do ont think you can create a loophole of this rule by hurting someone on your own team (i.e. Mafia member reveals another mafia member's identity). In this case, you are stupid.\n\nGiving out information.\n\nIf you wish to tell the players of the game a message, you have a couple of legal channels to do so. One, you can post this information in the voting thread or two you can send a private message to players. You can not, however, create another account and use it to hide your identity while giving out information. If you want to say something, you must accept the responsibility of being known as saying it.\n\n\nThat should about cover the rules for playing the game. If there is something you are still confused about or something I didn't mention that you think should be covered, you can let me know by sending me a message or just posting it in this thread.

But it is not based on that movie alone. Rather, I felt it was the best title for this theme. The Wild West. Yes sir, for Mafia 19, we're doing it old school. So, let's get out back story started.\n\nThe Story\n\nPrologue:\n\nThe evening sun was bleeding out its final light on the day. Sheriff Rock Williams watched the sky. It had been another long day that kept getting worse and he was thankful that it was finally over. Another two ranchers had been found dead today. The work of Col. Sancho Volonté and his bandits. They had been terrorizing this countryside for a month now with great success. With the deaths of Stevens and Baker today, there were few, if any, who would dare openly oppose Volonté's gang now. \n\nIndeed, Rock had already seen the effect the news of the deaths had on the townsfolk. Paranoia, fear and helplessness. It was on everyone's faces. It was expressed by everyone's body language. The deaths today seemed to signal the end of a war. Defeat. That's what it was. Defeat was what everyone felt. Volonté had won and he was now the lord of this county. \n\nRock sighed. Had he been responsible for this? He had been sheriff for so long now. Had he gotten too old? Too tired? Too lax? He had the respect and admiration of the townsfolk for so many years. But more importantly, he had their trust. Not automatically but because he earned. Because he had fought hard to preserve its citizens and to protect their freedom. Success after success. Anyone who dared start trouble didn't last long. But was the relative peace that everyone had enjoyed for some time the cause of this? Was it because there had been no trouble for so long, that he now forgot how to deal with it? Had success made Rock ignorant that he might be defeated? \n\nRock knew that his reaction to Volonté had not been swift when his band started causing trouble. In fact, Rock knew now that he had underestimated the threat of this group. That slow start is no doubt why it felt like Rock he was always trying to catch up to Volonté; why it felt Volonté was always ahead of him. And today, the truth about Volonté and his band had finally been revealed to Rock. \n\nAfter the death of Stevens and Baker had been conveyed to the town, Rock quickly gathered a posse to follow the trail left behind by Volonté and his men. It was more just a token show of force. Nothing had come of the other times he had rode out against this group. But it appears success had also affected Volonté and his men as this time, they did leave a trail behind and only halfheartedly attempted to throw people off it. After following the trail for some time it eventually looped back towards the town. This concerned Rock since he feared the band may have felt brazen enough to now attack the town in broad daylight. Rock and his posse kept following the trail as it came closer and closer to town. And then he was unable to follow it any longer as it joined the main road leading into the town. It appeared Volonté had decided on riding into town after all. Rock and the posse quickly sped back to the town to see if everyone was all right.\n\nThey were. There had been no disturbance in the town since he rode out. Puzzled, Rock tried to figure out what had happened. He followed the main road some more but there was no sign of Volonté and his men's trail coming off the main road after they got on it. How could they have just vanished? They couldn't have gone back on the road or they would have been spotted by Rock and his posse. But if they went forwards and into town, they would have spotted which is something they had avoided. No one had yet been able to give a description of Volonté and his men for anyone that saw them was killed. Since no reported seeing any strangers on the road, Rock couldn't figure out what had happened. Until Maria came.\n\nAs John Baxter, the town's doctor, came out of the house and on to the porch, Rock turned away from his view of the starry night sky to hear the verdict.\n\n\"How is she?\" Rock asked.\n\n\"She's dead,\" John flatly responded.\n\nRock sighed again, his shoulders limp and head to the floor. \"Hell,\" he whispered. It was all he could think of saying.\n\n\"Care to tell me what happened to her?\" John asked.\n\n\"Volonté,\" Rock answered.\n\n\"I could surmise that. But why her?\" John pressed, \"What did Maria do?\"\n\n\"It wasn't Maria they were after. It was her husband,\" Rock replied.\n\n\"Henry? He's not a wealthy fellow. He barely gets by month after month. What would Volonté have wanted from him?\" John asked.\n\nRock raised his eyes up from the floor and faced John again. \"I'll let you know. Not just you but the whole town tomorrow. When you ride back tonight, let everyone know that Sheriff Rock Williams has an announcement to make about Col. Sancho Volonté and his gang. Tell them that I have a solution to this problem also and that Volonté's reign of terror is coming to an end,\" Rock steely explained.\n\n\"Alright Rock. But you better mean it. This town is running out of hope fast,\" John said.\n\n\"I mean it,\" Rock replied. Then he got on his horse and rode home. John Baxter watched him ride off for a bit and then saddled up on to his horse and rode into to town.

There's the mafia, ruthless killers, thieves, and conspirators.  They work covertly and kill at night.  In this game, Mrs. Wormwood, Good Calvin, Rosalyn, Moe, and Mr. Lockjaw comprise our mafia.  Their goal?  To kill or control all the townies.  To do this, their numbers must equal or be higher than the remaining townies, with both the Killer and the Suicide Bomber dead.\n\nThen there's the townies.  The normal, good natured citizens of the city.  They work hard, sweat and toil, only to find evil amidst them.  In this game, Calvin, Hobbes, Calvin's Mom, Calvin's Dad, Uncle Max, Stupendous Man, and Spaceman Spiff comprise the townies.  Their goal is to rid the town of the aggressive, secret oppressors, the mafia, by killing them all.\n\nEach day, everyone in the town votes to kill a member of the town, or if the townies elect, they can choose not to vote as well.  The player with the most votes at the end of the day is lynched.\n\nIn this specific game of Mafia, we're playing with Calvin and Hobbes characters, locations, items, and motives.  When a player is killed, he is hit with one of Calvin's new Transmogrifier rays, which is now permanent.  The player will then turn into something else, like a worm or a lamp, and will no longer be allowed to participate in the game in any way.\n\nIn this game, there are several roles.  The descriptions in the post below describe how players with the said roles win and lose.  All players who do not receive a role in the post below will be Calvin's Classmates, who, caught in the middle of an incident bigger than Noodles, just don't want to turn into lions, tigers, bears, or anything like that.  The roles will be edited for clarity as needed, but there probably won't be any major changes at this point.  Calvin's Classmates are on the townie side.\n\nThe setting is the panels of Calvin and Hobbes.  Anywhere that occurs in the strips can be in this game.  The camping grounds, the school, or anywhere is available.\n\nTime passes during the game of mafia similarly to how time passes in real life.  The game is divided into two sections, night and day.  During the day, generally the only major event that occurs is the vote.  Each player may vote for a player to kill of his or her choosing.  In this game, immediately after the day ends, the vote ends, and the player with the most votes is killed.  In the event of a tie, no tie-breaker time will be allotted.  instead, the two people who lose the vote will send me a PM of one person they'd each like to kill, then 3/4 of the players that were voted for/picked will die, at random.  Yes, this means you can tie in the vote, pick any player you want to die, and still live, it's just unlikely that this would happen.  Also during the day, all night actions need to be PM'ed to me.  I will not accept any late night actions.\n\nDuring the night, several things take place.  After planning their moves during the day, all the roled players who have night abilities will act, believe it or not, simultaneously.  For example, if the mafia's hit ends up on Calvin's Mom, and she chooses to mend Hobbes that night, then she dies, but Hobbes is also mended.  This all takes place after a player is voted out, so if Calvin's Mom decided to mend Hobbes, but is then voted out, Hobbes will not be mended.\n\nIn this game, the day will be considered \"Class Time,\" and the night will be considere \"Out of School\""], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.268073"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.268073"]]

Why did she get up early again?  Oh yeah!  She knew it was supposed to rain today, the best time to hook an elusive Coelacanth.  After cramming her fishing pole into her dress, she made her way outside.  As the news had forecasted, a steady rain was falling.  Pulling out her stylish umbrella, she skipped merrily down to the beach.  Once there, she started walking as to avoid scaring away her unsuspecting prey.  A shadow!  She cast her line in the direction the shadow was looking.  The fish then turned and swam the other direction!  \"Augh!,\" she murmured, as she cast her line again....and again...and again...Finally she hooked the fish!  \"A SEABASS?  WHAT THE ****!?\"  As she chucked the fish back into the sea she caught a face-full of tail.  But Tangy wasn't about to give up.  She caught another sea bass, and another...and another...\"Where are all the good fish!?,\" she cried out in disgust.  Then a unusually large shadow caught her eye.  She cast her line, and she hooked.  As she quickly reeled in her catch, her twinkling eyes turned to confusion, and then to fear.  What she had reeled in was not a fish, but the body of a recently murdered villager.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWelcome to the world of Animal Crossing...Town Name: Vale...Population: Diminishing\n\nLet me introduce myself.  I am the Mayor of Vale, Mayor Khushrenada.  As you can see, Vale isn't exactly your usual, friendly Animal Crossing town.  Rather, we've pulled in some dark individuals that thrive on ambition and deceit...And I don't just mean the usual \"tree choppers.\"  It's not a secret that the local monopolizing raccoon, Tom Nook, and his trusty \"Crooked Cranny 'Coons\" are at war with Black Market veteran Crazy Redd; bodies are found all the time!  And if that were bad enough, I've been receiving suicide bomb threats for the past few weeks!  But no matter, I've decided enough is enough...All of the villagers will be locked inside the town until this matter is sorted out.  Good luck to all of you...\n\n~Mayor Khushrenada\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow the prologue is out of the way, let me introduce you to the roles of the game!\n\nMayor Khushrenada - That's me, your loving grandfather figure!  I'll be monitoring your progress and tallying your votes...\n\nCrooked Cranny 'Coons - The \"top dog\" gang in town...The Godfather, Tom Nook, has been monopolizing the market for years.  Because they don't know the members of the Black Market Foxes, they will take out everyone in the town with them, but only on odd days...(Tom Nook's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nBlack Market Foxes - The Godfather of this gang, Crazy Redd, decided to take advantage of Tom Nook's price gouging monopoly a few months back, and has been undercutting the prices of all of Nook's goods (legal and not-so legal) ever since...Like the 'Coons, they wish to get rid of their enemy as soon as possible...They will make hits on even days...(Crazy Redd's identity to Detective Copper is \"Villager\")\n\nDetective Copper - our local cop has taken it upon himself to locate the members of each gang and bring them to justice.  Being the perfectionist he is, he only investigates the identity of one town member each night.\n\nMint - This spunky squirrel gets around town faster than anyone, and if you've played Animal Crossing, you know just how fast it is to get around town...With her powers of \"persuasion,\" she is able to sway a close vote in the direction she desires every night...\n\nBlanca - A mysterious foreigner made her way into town before the gates were closed.  She can steal the face of a single person at any point in the game (overnight), killing the original owner of the role in the process...If Blanca ends up wishing to kill someone who is being targetted by Death or Mafia, Blanca will reach the victim first...If Blanca kills Cube, she will die...\n\nK.K. Slider - The local guitar-strumming legend is also an ally of justice...Upset at the general lack of motivation of the Villagers in tracking down the scum of Vale, he's become a vigilante...He has enough time to plan one attack on a single person every night, but if kills an innocent his life is forfeit...\n\nDeath AKA Mr. Resetti - Who we believe to be a very strict anti-reset mole is actually a messenger from above...He can leave his hole every night to kill one person of his choice...However, if he kills Sable, he will forfeit his position in this world as well...EDIT: I forgot to note that Detective Copper sees Death as a Villager as well...\n\nGuardian Angel AKA Sable - The calm seamstress is the second messenger sent from the other side...She knows the intentions of Death every night, and can protect a single person from Death's touch over the course of the game...otherwise, she can protect one person a night...I guess it's also important to note that Detective Copper is not a medium (one who can see ghosts), and thus Sable's identity to him is \"Villager\"...\n\nCube the Suicide Penguin - This crazy penguin is the most dangerous character of the game, and there is no reasoning for his threats...\n- can choose 2 people to kill on one night, but he also dies\n- if he is killed over-night, the person that killed him also dies\n- if he is voted off, all of those who voted for him will die\n\nBomber's Apprentice - Unfortunately, Cube has taken in an apprentice...When or if Cube dies, his protege will take over the role of Suicide Bomber...It is also important to note that the Apprentice could be ANYONE in the game, even if they already have a role...If the Apprentice has another role, their other role will be their identity if they are investigated...\n\nVillagers - Innocent townies who just want to live the rest of their lives fishing, gardening, and insect catching in peace...\n\nThe game will begin two Mondays from now, Feb. 9...This should be a fun game, so be as creative as you wish!

Gadd was working in his lab on what was to be the pinnacle of his career: The \"Super Heated Reticulation Ocular Oscillation Mega-gun\" or S.H.R.O.O.M. Gun. which, if working correctly, could could turn ANY mushroom into a Power Mushroom!  Mario had to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser three times this year, and was beginning to run low on his back stock of Power Mushrooms.  \n\nThe good professor got up from his chair and headed over to his bag of standard, regular plain-ol mushrooms.  He reached in the bag, pulled out a mushroom, and gave it a good once over.  It smelled like a normal mushroom, it LOOKED like a normal mushroom, and after a quick bite - it tasted like a normal mushroom.  He gave out a triumphant whoop and raced back to his desk.  He placed the mushroom on his desk, and took a few steps back, with the S.H.R.O.O.M. gun in hand.  He fired the gun at the mushroom and then BOOM!  \n\nThere was a white light... it seemed to last forever, but in reality, it was only maybe a minute.  When the light subsided, he peered at the mushroom.  Nothing had changed!  His device hadn't worked!  \n\nBut wait.... as he walked toward the mushroom, he noticed something was different.  He looked down at his legs and screeched - his pants had transformed!  Also his shoes.  Professor E. Gadd was suddenly filled with dread, and raced over to a mirror.  ACK!  He looked just like Toad!  He reached over to his shelf and grabbed a picture that was taken shortly after last month's great rescue of Princess Peach.  The picture contained Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad.  And after a quick comparison, YES!  E. Gadd was suddenly IDENTICAL to Toad!  \n\nE. Gadd felt very strange, and went back to his desk to go over the plans for his device.  What had caused this?  Were there any other side effects?  \n\nIt was only a few minutes later when he heard a very loud knocking at his door.  He went to answer the door and was completely taken aback by what he saw: Dozens upon Dozens of clones of TOAD!  The gun had transformed the ENTIRE MUSHROOM KINGDOM into clones of Toad!  How strange!\n\nOne of the toads came forward, wearing a nametag that said \"My Name Is Actually Princess Peach\".  She was furious at the professor and started throwing vegetables at him.  He wasn't sure how she got a hold of so many vegetables, but now wasn't the time to question!\n\n\"People of the Mushroom Kingdom, I understand you're upset!  I will have NO problem transforming you all back to your normal selves, but I will need some time!   I happen to have the formula for a potion that will undo what I've done, but I will only be able to make one dose a day! For now, you've all got name tags!  That should help!\"\n\nIt was then that the Toad who called himself \"Princess Peach\" described what had been happening down at the castle when everything had gone awry - Bowser had launched a full on assault! Bowser, as well as a number of Koopa Troopa, the Hammer Bros, and Bob-omb were all inside the castle when everyone was changed.\"\n\n\"We have no way of knowing who is who, except for to take their word on it!\"\n\nE. Gadd knew he was in for a stressful week..."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.287670"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.287670"]]

As the first major celebrity of the Punch-Out tournament, this ear biting maniac has a lot of clout  He has the ability to knock out one player a night by sending his fellow mafia henchmen  He must choose himself, or a specific henchman to perform the hit.  If Mike Tyson is eliminated from the game, one of the mafia members will ascend to his throne.  This is done via a vote amongst the remaining Mafia members.    Mike Tyson will appear as \"Townie\" if he is investigated.  ONLY Mike Tyson can perform a hit on Mr. Dream without being knocked out.\n\nMafia Members - Will be dependent on how many sign up. But there will be two roles within the membership\n\nGreat Tiger- Not only is he is a veteran of the ring but he has what some consider supernatural powers. Utilizing his hypnotic powers, Great Tiger is able to read one person's role ONCE during the game. So make sure you choose wisely.\n\nDon Flamenco- Using his mesmerizing dance routine he has made hearts melt, both male and female. Once during the game Don Flamenco can choose to dance into the heart of the townies winning the knowledge of 2 random roles from the townie alliance. The only problem is that he sometimes can't help himself from being wooed himself if his name comes out 4 times out 5 flips and a random mafia role will have to be given up for everyone to see (Isn't love beautiful?). Will he be willing to take that chance? If his charms work, the random townie roles will be given ONLY to him, and the only individuals that are impervious to his charms are Mr. Dream, Big Bertha, and Bald Bull. Oh did I forget to mention that if Great Tiger's power is used, that discovered role WILL be included in the random list of potential townie role reveals so there is a chance he may only get back one unknown role? \n\nIf Tyson is taken out a mafia member can ascend to Godfather by a majority the vote. The only catch is that the mafia will not get a knock out that night.\n\nImposter- Super Macho Man\n\nHis experience in the ring under different ring leaders lends itself nicely to him being able to impersonate any role he chooses.. He can choose one person a night to impersonate.  If that person is the same person that  Mr. Dream investigates, then that investigation will come back \"Mafia\" even if the person is innocent.\n\n\nTownie Roles:\n\nInvestigator - Mr. Dream\n\nAfter seeing a resurgence of Mike Tyson in the Punch-Out!! tournament, Mr. Dream has decided the best course of action was to take the \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" approach and has joined up the Little Mac Clone Townie Alliance Punch-Out!! Force.  Using his influence and fear tactics he can get anyone (except Mike Tyson himself) to confess their allegiance.  He can investigate any player once a night and will learn their role.  The only Tyson Mafia member who can knock out Mr. Dream safely is Mike Tyson himself.  If any other Tyson Mafia members attempt to hit Mr. Dream, they will be knocked out along with Mr. Dream\n\nProtector - Doc Louis\n\nDoc  has always been on Little Mac's side, and helping protect those in the Little Mac Clone Townie Alliance was a no brainier for him.  Doc will choose one player to protect from death by Mafia hit, Bald Bull suicide charge, or a Big Bertha knock out attempt, so that player will be saved from being knocked out unconscious.  Doc cannot prevent knock out caused by placing a hit on, or voting out, Big Bertha.  Doc cannot protect himself from knock out.\n\nSaint - King Hippo\n\nThe Little Mac Clone Townie Alliance loves this big lovable loose short heavyweight. If they can't knock his pants off, no one can . If King Hippo is voted out by the players, then the player who INITIALLY cast a vote for King Hippo will be lynched and killed immediately.  If a player stars the bandwagon, but later changers their vote, then they are still responsible for the bandwagon.  Start your bandwagons carefully.\n\nVote changer - Glass Joe\n\nAfter multiple embarrassments and a pathetic win-loss record, Glass Joe has had enough. He will do what he can to influence other people's matches.   Glass Joe can use the pity he has received throughout his life to change a single vote once a day.  He can cancel a vote out, or change the name on the vote.  Glass Joe's ability does not affect King Hippo's ability.  Much like a player cannot change their vote to un-bandwagon themselves, Glass Joe cannot un-bandwagon a player.  He submits his choice at night.  \n\nLittle Mac Prime:\nThe trouble with having tons of Little Mac clonesrunning around is that the original has gotten lost in the shuffle.Will the real Little Mac please stand up? This is a special role that will be activated on an already predetermined date. A random normal townie will be awarded the ability to have ONE knock-out of ANY character in the game without any fear of being knocked out himself, this includes the Bomber role as well. As stated though, this is a one time ability which will be activated later on. The only catch is that if this player is a recipient of one of the two bomber suicide choices, a Godfather or killer hit, or a vote by the peeps his action will be null and void and will be knocked out of the game.\n\nOther Roles:\n\nKiller- Big Bertha\n    The punch-out tournament has been a male only event ever since its inception. Big Bertha's goal is to show the men that a female can hang with the best of them. She will do whatever it takes to prove to the world that women can kick butt as well. Each night Big Bertha can take out one participant of her choosing.\n\n\nBomber- Bald Bull\nBald Bull is not afraid to put his head down and rush towards danger. The only problem is that he leaves himself wide open. If Bald Bull is voted out, he will take out a random half of those who voted for him.  If he is taken out by the mafia, he will take out the Godfather of the mafia. If he is take out by Big Bertha, Big Bertha will go with him.  Bald Bull also can take out any two members of his choosing at any time, but that action will also take Bald Bull with them. If Bald Bull loses a vote by his peers, that will supercede his two person sacrificial knockout blow. On the flip side he can utilize his sacrificial knockout EVEN IF a hit is put out on him that same night\n\n\nWin conditions:\n\nTyson MAFIA: Eliminate all townies until the number of townies is equal or lesser to the number of Mafia. Eliminate Big Bertha. Eliminate Bald Bull.\n\nPunch-Out Townies: Eliminate all members of the Mafia.  Eliminate Big Bertha, the killer. Also eliminate the bomber, Bald Bull\n\nKiller: Be the last woman standing.\n\nBomber- Be the last man standing, or responsible for knocking out the last remaining players. \n\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.289534"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.289534"]]

The objective is to find each teams \"flags\" and capture them or eliminate them from play.  \n\nThe 3 teams are:  Team Mario, Team Bowser, and Team Wario.\n\nOk, just thought I would post the order of events just in case people want to know.\n\nThe Days vote is always the first action to occur.\nThe next action to occur is always Wario's action if he chooses to act.\nThe following action will occur in the order that I get them.  So runners and gunners actions will be processed in the order they were received.\n\nNight actions like investigations and General's identity change occur the beginning of next day.  As such, a General can not investigate someone AND change roles the same day...it is one or the other.\n\nTeam Mario and Team Bowser are the two largest teams.  They are playing against each other to see who can beat the other in paintball.  Each team will have designated Flags which will know each other and will work together to try to rally their team for a win.  \n\nTeam Wario is a wildcard team that is just up for mischief and want to disrupt the game in whatever way they can.  The Wario team's size is unknown, but they don't have any flags because they are not part of the tournament.  To win Team Wario needs to eliminate both teams before they are capable of defeating the other team.  This can be done by capturing the last flag of each team at the same time, or eliminating all the players on a team except for the flags.  \n\nBasic Roles:\n\nFlags:  Are a special Role on Team Mario and Team Bowser.  The Flags know who each other are and act to a similar way to mafia in traditional games.  The Mario Flags know each other, but can not attack with guns.  They can only be eliminated by either Vote Out, Capture, or Team Wario Attack.  The game is over when all the flags on one team is eliminated.  There will either be 3 to 4 flags per team.\n\nFlags: must rely on their knowledge of their team to lead votes and try to protect each other.  They truly are the leaders of their team, but be careful who you trust, because you may be talking to the enemy.\n\nGunners:  The Gunners are the most basic role of the game (they are the townies of the game)  Gunners start out with 5 paintballs each for the entire game.  They can choose to use all their paintballs at once or save them for later in the game.  Each paintball has a 25% chance of hittings its target.  You can increase the odds by shooting up to 3 paintballs at a single target.  So 1 paintballs = 25%, 2 paintballs = 50%, and 3 Paintballs = 75% of hitting your target.  There is always a chance of avoiding an attack.  \n\nGunners do not have any idea who anyone is on their team.  They don't know who each other are or their flags.  So it you must be careful who you trust and who you target.  Once you run out of paintballs all you can do is vote.  \n\nRunners: do not have a paintball gun, but they can capture flags from the other team with their action.  If a runner captures a flag, the captured flag is eliminated from the game, and the runner becomes a new flag for their team.  Once they are a flag, they will be informed who the rest of their team's flags are.  Runners can turn the tables on a game, by allowing the team to strength from a weakened position, and stay in the game.\n\nGenerals aka MARIO & BOWSERl   The General has the ability to become any Role for a team, except a flag.  Once the general has chosen a role he is no longer a General and becomes that new role with all their abilities.  While he is the General (and not chosen a role) the General can investigate one person each night and determine what role they have and what team they are on.  Unfortunately as the General he can not attack.\n\n\n\nTeam Wario\n\nTeam Wario are special roles that have only 2 weapons.  1 is a Paintball gun with a 100% hit ratio.  This paint gun can take out a flag or a gunner.  The other weapon is a Paint grenade.  The Paint Grenade can target 2 opponents of their choice and has a 100% accuracy.  The Paint Grenade is the perfect weapon for Team Wario to achieve their goal of eliminating both teams final flags.  Team Wario can only be eliminated by vote out.  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nActions:\n\nAll Roles have the responsibility to vote in the daily thread.  If you do not vote in a thread you will not die.  However, if you do not vote and you are a gunner you will lose a paintball.  This will encourage everyone to participate in the daily thread vote.  Besides, this game is going to be fast and furious so it is important to start voting soon.\n\nGunners:  Gunners send a private message to me to target their shots.  Once they send in their shots it can not be edited or changed.   This is because I will be determining my actions by the order they come to me.  Private Messages can start coming in the second I start the new day.  If you send them in earlier I will not count that action.  To be fair to my overseas players, before the game starts you can write me a special request to send actions in early.  This must be arranged before the game starts, and the private message needs to be sent to me over the night before the new day starts.  Otherwise, I will treat it like any other action in that order.  You will not be told if your actions hit, miss, or hit a flag.  You will just have to make assumptions based on what happens in the game.\n\nRunners:  Your actions are night actions, so before the start of each day you send in your actions and they will occur first thing the start of the next day.  So that means day 0, you can send in a target.  If you target a flag for your action then you capture that flag and take them out of the game.   The target is out of the game, and you become the flag.  This works for targeting opposing flags, and targeting your own flags, so be careful who you target.   Once you are a flag you are not a runner anymore and will be informed of the other flags on your team.  If you target anyone else, your action fails.\n\nSpies actions are night actions, so before the start of each day send in a player you would like to investigate, at the beginning of the day you will learn that players role and what team they are one.  This means before day 1 begins you can send in a target on 'day 0'\n\nGeneral's The general's actions are night actions to change roles.  However, once you change roles you have to wait until next day to use your new role.  So on Day 1 Night if you become a Gunner you can not use your attacks for Day 2.  You must wait til Day 3.\n\nTeam Wario:  Your actions are always night actions.  This means your actions will always have precedence over all other attacks.  This gives you a big advantage.  You can also send in your actions if you choose on 'day 0' for a day 1 action.  But remember you only have 2 actions the entire game.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClarification # 1)  Although the vote is one of the few ways to eliminate a flag.  Anyone role voted out is out of the game.   \n\n8 Members Team Mario/Team Bowser\n\n3-Flags Each Team\n1-General Each Team\n2-Runner Each Team\n2-Gunners Each Team\n\nThe Leaves 1 Member for Team Wario. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk, just thought I would post the order of events just in case people want to know.\n\nThe Days vote is always the first action to occur.\nThe next action to occur is always Wario's action if he chooses to act.\nThe following action will occur in the order that I get them.  So runners and gunners actions will be processed in the order they were received.\n\nNight actions like investigations and General's identity change occur the beginning of next day.  As such, a General can not investigate someone AND change roles the same day...it is one or the other."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.291696"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.291696"]]

First of all there is no actual mafia team; effectively both teams are townies. All members will be assigned an item to use according to the rules. These items will be replaced the next day upon their use.\n\nAll players start with 3 points.\nTo die, you must be voted out in the day actions or you must have your points depleted by being attacked by other players to zero.\n\nAll players are effectively townies; however they are affiliated to different teams. All players will have assigned items that are replaced the next day following its use (except the Green Team).\n\nThere are three teams: \nRed Team\nBlue Team\nGreen Team\n\nThe Red and Blue Teams will have equal amounts of players, while the Green Team has a smaller number of players. To compensate for a smaller team, all actions the Green Team make takes priority over all others.\nAs the green team has priority their action would be placed first regardless of whether it really was or not. So, for instance, if a green player and red player remained and both has 1 point remaining, and they both fired red shells at each other then the red player would die first.\n\nFor either the Red or Blue Teams to win, the opposing team plus the Green Team must die. For the Green Team to win, they must defeat all the members of either team (only one team). \n\nTo clarify:\nNobody will know who other members are (except for Green Team, who will know other Green players).\nFor the Red Team to win, they must defeat half the members of the Blue Team and AT LEAST HALF OF the Green Team.\nFor the Blue Team to win, they must defeat half the members of the Red Team and AT LEAST HALF OF the Green Team. (So, if the opposing team has 10 this must be reduced to 5 for Red/Blue to win)\nFor the Green Team to win, they must defeat half the members of the Red Team OR the Blue Team. (So, for example if Red Team has 10, Green need to reduce that number to 5 for Green to win)\n\nGreen must maintain at least half of their team, and not fall below this. I.E If they had 10, then 6 is the minimum.\n\nITEMS:\n\nBOTH TEAMS:\nRed Shell - Removes one point from nominated person. Can be used offensively or defensively.\n\nBlue Shell - Removes one point from all opposing team. All weapons ineffective except Star and POW.\nBanana - Protects against all offensive items except blue shells and POW.\n\nMystery Box - Removes one point from nominated person. Can only be used offensively.\n\nCoin - Restores one point to nominated person. Same day use. Alive players only.\n\nIdentifier - Allows user to find out who has what type of item. (e.g. \"Who has the Blue Shell?\"). The risk is if you use the item, you will have your answer and you will switch team.\n\nCloud - Removes 2 points from owner unless one point is used to transfer to someone else. Can only be transferred once. Cloud ‘attacks’ after second day.\n\nOil Spill – Randomises the points of 2 people.\nLightning - Cancels all votes on opposing team (can also cancel green votes), except for one person.\n\nThe Green Team will have 4 items for the entire game:\nBoo\nPOW\n2 x Red shells\n"], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.293960"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.293960"]]

Not only did the knife belong to him, it also had his fingerprints all over it. Moreover, a witness spotted him leaving Bill's office shortly after Bill fell from his top story office.\n \nMaya: That does seem pretty conclusive.\n \nGumshoe: You bet it does pal. And Detective Gumshoe always follows the evidence.\n \n*Phoenix selects \"Ian Sane\"*\n \nPhoenix: Tell me a little more about this Ian Sane person? What is he like?\n \nGumshoe: Well, he has a pretty strong personality. He's not afraid to speak his mind on many issues even if it is an unpopular view. I'm afraid it tends to rub people the wrong way and as such, he's not too well liked.\n \nMaya: Plus, he's the owner of a bunch of magazine companies like \"Another Perspective\", \"WWE History\", \"Pikmin Gardening Weekly\", and of course, \"The Rebuttal\".\n \nPhoenix: *That's a random array of titles* Why would he want to kill Bill?\n \nGumshoe: Well, last month, Ian wrote an article in \"The Rebuttal\" criticizing the way Mario, president of Disaster Relief, ran his organization. He thought it was ridiculous that Disaster Relief would only open up certain branches in different parts of the world and leave others neglected. Bill was a friend of Mario's and took his friend's side in the argument. It lead to some pretty heated debates in the papers.\n \nMaya: I think he only prints that stuff to get a reaction and get more sales. I hardly agree with any of the things he says.\n \nGumshoe: Me either. Each month, when I read his latest Editorial, I want to write back a whole bunch of rebuttals myself.\n \nMaya: Me too. It gets me wound up.\n \nPhoenix: Uh, then quit buying it.\n \nGumshoe: Are you kidding, pal? If I did that, what would happen to the motivation it gives me to fight for my opinion.\n \nMaya: Yeah. It helps me better realize how I feel on different topics.\n \nPhoenix: *Then why can't I figure out how you feel about him*\n \nGumshoe: Well, I have to go pal. The prosecution wants to talk to me about the case. Don't go messing up the crime scene while I'm gone now.\n \nMaya: And he's gone. Let's touch and poke everything we can.\n \nPhoenix: Good idea.\n \n*Phoenix messes up the entire crime scene*\n \nMaya: I found something!\n \nPhoenix: What it is it?\n \nMaya: A needle. I was digging through this garbage can and pushed my hand right into it. Should we put it into evidence?\n \nPhoenix: I'm not so sure it's going to be useful to us.\n \nMaya: Everything's spinning. I need to lay down for awhile.\n \nPhoenix: Don't worry. I've called for an ambulance. I must admit, it is weird waiting for it to come to me instead of me chasing it. RIMSHOT!\n \n*Phoenix gives the needle to the medical personal*\n \nPhoenix: Well, I can't find anything here. Maybe Gumshoe really did find all the clues this time.\n\n? ? ?: Psst. Over here.\n \nPhoenix: Who said that? Gah! There's a man waving to me in the lobby. Guess I'll see what this is all about since the story won't move forward until I do.\n \n---------------------------\nNovember 21, 11:30 AM\nThe Pyropizm Corporation\nMain Floor Lobby\n---------------------------\n \nPhoenix: Did you want to see me?\n \nKhushrenada: Yes. Hello. My name is Khushrenada. I wanted to talk to you about what happened with Bill.\n \nPhoenix: What about?\n \nKhushrenada: Ian Sane. The police have arrested him but he didn't do it.\n \nPhoenix: How do you know about that?\n \nKhushrenada: It is all over the news. \n \nPhoenix: Oh. Well, what do you want from me?\n \nKhushrenada: I want you to represent him and defend him.\n \nPhoenix: Oh. I don't think so. The evidence seems clear. I looked myself and couldn't find anything unusual.\n \nKhushrenada: No. He is innocent. You must help him.\n \nPhoenix: How can you be so sure?\n \nKhushrenada: Because Ian Sane would never break the rules and killing a fellow member is definitely against the rules.\n \nPhoenix: Fellow member? Rules? What are you talking about?\n \nKhushrenada: I am not at liberty to say too much but myself, the victim, the suspect, the real killer and many others are all linked to one another through a secret organization.\n \nPhoenix: What is this organization?\n \nKhushrenada: I'm not going to give you all the answers right now. I just told you that. Meet me at this location tomorrow morning and I will tell you more then. In the meantime, please take the case. If anyone can find Ian Sane innocent, it is you Phoenix Wright. And now this, others are working to help you on this case. You will not fight alone.\n \n*Khushrenada runs away*\n \nPhoenix: Right. They always say that until the trial where I actually have to fight alone. Now I'm curious what this is all about. What should I do now? Take the case of course. Guess I'll go meet my client.\n \n-------------------------\nNovember 21, 3:45 PM\nDetention Center\nVisitation Room\n-------------------------\n \nIan Sane: Who are you?\n \nPhoenix: I'm Phoenix Wright. I've heard about your troubles today and against my better judgement, I've decided to offer my services to you.\n \nIan: What? No way! Awesome. I got the greatest defense lawyer in the whole world. Everyone knows you are an expert on pinning the blame on someone else. I'm going to be free in no time.\n \nPhoenix: W-W-W-WHAT!? No, it doesn't work like that. I don't pin blame...\n \nIan: Well, I'll see you tomorrow.\n \nPhoenix: Whoa! Wait! Come back. I need to talk to you about what happened.... today...... He left. *sigh* Why don't I keep my office locked? I could prevent a lot of this stuff before it even happened. Well, guess I'll see my client tomorrow. At least he'll have to stick around longer then.\n \nTo be continued.........."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.306359"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.306359"]]

There is no godfather. Instead, any one of the mafia members can send in the hit. This means that the mafia can work together and agree on a pick or someone can just say screw it, I'm doing it my way. The first member to send in a hit choice is the hit that will be chosen. Now let's say player 1 sends in a hit and later in the day player 2 sends in a hit. But then player 1 changes his hit to someone else. That will be considered a new hit and player 2's choice will then be the hit selection since player 1 has nullified his earlier hit choice. If anyone wants further clarification on this role, just ask, I'm happy to explain it further. Finally, if the player who sends in the hit is voted out that day, his hit will not go through but chances are the mafia will make just make sure someone else sends in the hit.\n \n \nThe Man of a Thousand Faces - Due to his amazing acting ability, this player is able to disguise himself and not be detected by any who might be trying to pursue him. Basically, this means that if investigated, the investigation will come back as proclaiming any role in the game the player chooses.\n \nThe Pony Killer - This role came about because Vudu wanted a pony. So, spoilers ahead. In The Godfather, a director will not bow to the Godfather's wishes and cast a person in a movie role. To make him an offer he can't refuse, the director's prized horse is killed and its head is put in the director's bed while he's sleeping. He wakes up the next day horrified and does what the mafia asks. What's that you say? It's not a spoiler, everyone knows that. Oh. Anyways, like the movie, this player can make another player \"an offer he can't refuse\" and change that player's vote. For story purposes, we'll say he does it by killing a person's pony and puts the head in an odd location.\n \nThe Drug Dealer - Can't handle the fame and pressure of being in the spotlight? Don't worry, your pal here has just what you need. The drug dealer can choose any player and offer them a free sample. If the player chooses to accept, he will soon find himself hooked and doing whatever the dealer asks to get his next fix. Basically, the dealer can try and recruit a player over to the mafia side. He will give me the name of a player he would like to send a gift package to. I'll pm that player with the offer. I'll let the dealer know the response. If the person accepts, he will learn the identity of the dealer at the beginning of the next game day and join the mafia side. If he refuses, the dealer is able to offer another player his \"gift\" the next day. If the dealer is killed, the player who was hooked will be taken out of the game for one day and put in rehab. Once out of rehab, the player has a choice he will pm me with. Will he go back to clean living and join the townies or will the experience have done nothing for him and he wishes to stay with his bad influence friends and stay mafia? Drugs. Just say no.\n \nTownie Roles\n \nThe Fan Favorite\n\nThis player can not be killed by the mafia only by public popularity. This player can only die by getting voted out of the game since that will be a sign of the public turning on him. With no fans to see his movies he will be washed up. Alternative title for this role: Ben Affleck. Haw haw.\n\nThe Producer\n\nThis is his production and you are going to have to do things his way. His vote can never be changed or influenced by another player. If the pony killer tries his crap on him, he'll hunt the pony killer down and kill him. This is a whammy for the The Pony Killer obviously.\n \nMotion Picture Production Code\n\nAlso known as the moral or Hayes Code. As the enforcer of this code, you have the power to change scenes and scripts in Hollywood to live up to your values. And if anyone should try to offer you drugs, they'll have committed career suicide. This is a whammy for the Drug Dealer.\n \n\n \nThe Point System\n\nYou may have noticed that I didn't list an investigator. For this game, I'm going to use a system a bit similiar to my warbucks idea from awhile back. In another suggestion I recieved, I was told I should make voting and posting everyday mandatory and try to eliminate to the non-participation strategy. I'd hoped my performance a few games ago would remind players that everyone is a threat not just the active players. That said, I've never begrudged anyone for using the non-active route and I'm not going to with this game. Sorry anonymous suggestor. That said, I've always believed in rewarding the active players and that is what I have here with this point system. \n \nHow does it work? \n \nIf you cast a vote, you get a point. That means when I lock the day thread, you have a vote in bold for another player. Self votes do not count. Voting during the day then cancelling it later does not count. It must be a vote that stands when the tally is counted. \n \nIf the player you voted for is the one voted out that day, you get another point. This might encourage bandwagons but for those who are smart, you'll try and keep the voting close to keep other players from getting that extra point.\n \nI will give out points for roleplay and game play posts. You can get 1 more point a day for this. That said, there is a limit on these points. I will only give out 3 points for roleplay posts and 3 for gameplay posts. The roleplay points might come under a bit of criticism since it's a bit of judgement call but I think one can usually see which are the best of the day. The roleplay points are handed out at the end of the day so you have all day for that. As for the gameplay awards, they are first come first serve. I'll be handing them out during the day as I monitor the daily threads. What makes for a gameplay post? A post where a person makes a sound arguement, right or wrong. Where some sort of sensible reasoning is posted. What doesn't count? An accusation with no basis given, a current vote tally, stating how many hours are left in the day, I know you are but what am I arguments. Now you can still make those posts. I just won't give you a bonus for them.\n \nFinally, every player is worth 11 points. When a player is voted out, that point total is divided evenly among the ones who voted him out. Whatever points are left over are carried over to the next day and added to the total for the next day's vote. \n \nIt should be worth noting that the mafia does not get the total points a player has when making a hit on them. They can only get the points the same way as everyone else. Voting and posting.\n \nWhat can I get with my points?\n\nAs soon as you have enough points for an item, you can cash them in or hold on to them and keep accumulating them for something else. Some items are limited, some are unlimited.\n \nHire the tabloids:2 points - Want to spread a rumor but don't want it coming back to you. Give an anonymous tip to the gossip columnists. Everyday, the tabloids will be posted along with the story. Maybe the rumors are true or maybe they aren't. You have to decide if you want to trust the rumors. Availabilty - unlimited.\n \nHire an investigator:4 points - Want to get the dirt on the other players? Hire an investigator and learn their role. Availabilty - unlimited.\n \nStar Power:4 points - Don't like another co-star? The director? The writer? Then try using your star power. With the star power ability, your vote will now be worth the power of 3 votes. Moreover, if successful voting a person out, your vote will count as 3 when the point total is handed out giving you around three times the points. Beware though. If the Pony Killer uses his power on you while you have star power, that will be 3 votes for his choosing. Availability: unlimited.\n \nHire a bodyguard:6 points - Don't feel safe? Getting some creepy fan mail? Hire a bodyguard who will always love you. If you should get voted out or have a mafia hit come your way, the bodyguard will take the bullet for you. One time use only and then you'll have to hire somebody new if there's still someone around to take the job. Availability: 2\n \nJoin the Acadamy:8 points - Want to play a role in preserving the legacy of you and your fellow actor's work? Then join the acadamy. With this prestigious role, you are able to put forth your voice on a few issues. There are three issues you will get to specially vote. Bring a player back from the dead (lifetime achievement award), take away a player's points (fined for not paying dues), and eliminate a player (banished from Hollywood). Note there are only three spots available for the acadamy. However, if a player dies, then a spot is opened up and someone else can claim it. Matters can only be vote on when there are 3 players in the acadamy. There must be a majority on the issues being voted on for them to pass. Availability: 3.\n \nMulti-million dollar deal:13 points - Play hard to get and have the studio show you the money. With this contract, you have unlimited access to spread any tabloid rumors you want, you will be given one star power which you can use at anytime, and if a townie, you will randomly be given the names of two townies whom you can trust. If mafia, you get two free investigations. Availability: 1.\n \nNote: Unless otherwise stated, all bonus abilities must be used the day they are purchased or they expire and you waste the points for nothing."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.315525"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.315525"]]

After a heated argument breaks out amongst Mario and his friends, Peach decides to host a grand party filled with fun and games at the castle to determine who has the qualities of a real Superstar. Catching word of this event, Bowser paces back and forth, plotting a way to ruin this party, since he was not invited. Will the good times roll at the castle, or will Bowser and his cronies crash the party?\n\nGeneral\nThis game has no special roles, not even the Godfather. Instead, every ability is granted randomly each day, determined by a role of the die. This gives each and every player a chance to use a special power, but also adds an element of unpredictability. You never know who will end up with what, so anything can happen!\n\nAll actions happen overnight. An action can be sent in at any time during the day, and must be received before thirty minutes after the daily thread closes. Actions are not time-sensitive; some take priority over others. If an ability is not used by the end of the day, it does not carry over to the next day.\n\nThe Townies\nThere are no townie roles. Every ability which is usually associated with a townie role is now a random ability which will be assigned to each player every day, that will change every day.\n\nTownie rolls\n1: Red Space   \nThe player's vote for that day will not be counted in the tally. They may still cast a vote in the thread, it will just not count.\n2: Ballot Box Space\nThe player can change the vote of another player.\n3: Protection Space\nThe player will be protected from the nightly hit.\n4: Investigator Space\nThe player may investigate another player and learn their role.\n5: Blue Space\nThe player's vote for that day will count as two votes.\n6: Bob-omb Space\nThe player transforms into a bomb! If they are hit that night, then the Mafia member who performed the hit will lose along with the player. If the bomb player is voted out, the player who cast the first vote against the bomb player will be taken out as well.\n\nThe Mafia\nThe number of Mafia members will depend on the number of people who sign up. If we get the typical number of signups as we have these past few games, then there will probably be 4 Mafia.\n\nThere is no Godfather role. Instead, one member of the Mafia will be randomly selected each day to perform the nightly hit. All members will be informed who currently has this ability. If the member with the power is voted out that day, the hit will be stopped.\n\nMafia rolls:\n1 or 4: Feign Innocence Space\nIf this player is investigated on this day, they will come back as a townie.\n2 or 5: Nullify Space\nThe player can choose another player to nullify their ability, causing whatever it may be to be ineffective.\n3 or 6: Starman Space -or- 3: Red Space, 6: Blue Space\nThese numbers are situational. If the player with the hit power gets this, it will guarantee the nightly hit will be successful, regardless of any protection the target may have. Also grants protection from being exploded by a bomb player.

No one would seriously ever want to do that) and do it in bold. Votes not appearing like that will not count. You only get 1 vote a day. If you wish to change your vote, modify your original message to just say unvote Khushrenada and undo the bold and then post a new vote either in that same post or in a new one.

NOTE: As an added bonus, the Day's Executioner can not be killed by the mafia that night. A little extra bonus to play for. \n \nVoting Deadlines\n\nDays will end usually at midnight EST.

If the godfather is hit by the public executioner, the mafia still gets to make their hit. \n \nVoting Requirement!!!\n\nThere is a voting requirement of at least once every two days.

Avalable to Mafia at the start of the 4th day.Show up as Apprentice. He will also not know who the Mafia are until he is perminately a Mafia member by Starfires death.This is to prevent him from going back to being a townie and spilling the roles.His role will be controlled by Slade till he becomes a perminate role.

However he will morph back to his regular role the next day. If the person with the role doesn't choose to use their ability the first day then it show up as Plasmus until they choose to use thieir role.\n\nIf Slade dies then there will be a vote for a new leader and there won't be a hit that night.If someone is chosen as the hit for the night by Slade they won't be able to use their own abilities that night aside from Darkfire.\n The majority of the roles will be either one a night but not both a night for everybody.\n\n\nI think that is it.If anybody sees something you want add just mention it in the thread.

In the meantime, I figured we might as well get the ball rolling on sign-ups.\n \nTo all those who sign up, Kirby says Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.\n \nRoles/Rules\n \nAlright. So, if you were afraid I was going to do something like Public Executioners where we voted an executioner, I'm not. It will be the regular style of voting for whom you think is guilty.\n \nThere is only one mafia. Here it is:\n \nDark Matter Mafia\n \nDark Matter - The Force of Evil. The godfather of the Mafia. Because he can infect anyone, Dark Matter can not be identified by investigation. It's powerful eye-beam allows it to damage of 3 points to a player.\n \nKing Dedede - The Greedy Pengiun. His Hammer attack is worth 2 damage points. King Dedede also has a very powerful set of lungs and can suck in abilities. But he can not use them and will just digest them and thus remove that power for the rest of the game.\n \nMeta Knight - The Dark Kirby. No one knows the true story of Meta Knight but he once built a really wicked flying battleship to take over Dreamland and turned himself into legend. His sword ability is masterful and damage from it will cause 3 damage points to any player. His attack can also stun a player and prevent them from using an ability that day.\n \nWaddle Dee/Waddle Doo - The Cannon Fodder. As long as Dark Matter controls the mafia, Waddle Dee will be Waddle Doo. With his eye-beam, he can do 2 damage. If Dark Matter is eliminated, he goes back to being Waddle Dee and can do 1 damage by running into players. Clumsy oaf! However, because Waddle Dee is considered a weakling, nobody bothers to hide their hit points from him. Waddle Dee can see any players hit points and get continuous updates as long as they live.\n \nThe Killer\n \nMARX! - The master strategist? I hope we have enough players for this game. Marx, the genius, is once again posing as a harmless Dream Land resident. He has helped start this battle between Kirby and the Dark Matter Mafia. And while they are warring, he intends to slyly gain great power for himself. Marx can eliminate any player of his choosing. He will also gain that players ability which he can then use for the rest of the game until he is stopped.\n \nTownies\n \nKirby - Ability master. For the role of Kirby, something a little special will be done. Kirby will have a wall of options to choose from. Everyday, he can choose from that wall one choice which will reveal an item or ability. Kirby then has to decide if he wants to keep his current ability or swap for the new one. Whatever he doesn't choose will then be lost and unable to be chosen later.\n \nGooey - One of the choices in the Kirby wall of ability is Gooey. If that is selected, one townie will at random be chosen as Gooey. Kirby and Gooey will then know who each other is and can partner together.\n \nCitizens of Dreamland - These are regular townies and can vote each day. However, all citizens will be allowed to choose from another wall of abilities I have prepared and given a slight power that can be used each day as well."], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.329316"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.329316"]]

Out of the orb came the voice of King Zaden III:\n\n\n\"I would welcome you all here, but the circumstances under which we gather are the worst I could have ever imagined. Among you, there are people who would seek to not only undermine my rule, but harm the citizens of Leoria. It is up to us to weed out this evil and protect our kingdom.\"\n\n\nMurmurs of assent followed the king's statement, but the orb was not yet done:\n\n\n\"You have all been given names and appearances that will hide who you are, and in doing so, I hope that people's true intentions will be seen without the bias of history blinding the righteous. There are eight council members, myself, and two members of the Regal Guard who will take up the voting that will determine who is executed each night. You must all remain diligent, and sagacious. Trusting, but discerning. Unrelenting, but forgiving. As your king, I want this land to prosper, and its people to be happy. I fear that if we do not stop the usurpers, all hope for our people will be lost. We must fight, and we must win. Council be true!!\"\n\n\nSilenced followed the orb's evaporation, as those paying attention realized that there were thirteen people with their faces disfigured and wearing the blue robes that were supposed to signify them as members of the royal council; according to the king's orb, there should only have been eleven. \n\n\nAfter a few moments, it was the head chef who whispered loudly; \n\"There are two who do not belong, and making it worse, their addition makes the council number thirteen: the forbidden number.\"\n\n\nMore whispers followed this statement, but the council members feared to say anything, lest in being the first to speak, they put either a target on themselves for the usurpers or cast doubt on themselves for the pending vote. \n\n\nThe castle's servants, no longer feeling the magical pull that led them to the council room, began leaving slowly, milling around, trying to consolidate rumors and combine theories, before returning to their duties.\n\n\nWhen it was just the 13 supposed council members staring at each other nervously as a cold wind blew around the hems their robes, the Regal Guard entered the throne room and motioned for them to all be seated. \n\n\nWithout warning, a deep voice resounded from somewhere in the middle of the gathered guards:\n\"We were expecting there to be twelve of you, the council, the king, the guard members, and the demon. But we also know that the killer known as Rogue escaped the dungeons and was trapped here by our magic.\"\n\n\n\"You were expecting the demon?\" A voice called out. Luckily, all eyes were on the Regal Guard and the shouter went unnoticed and managed not to blush as everyone searched for the culprit.\n\n\n\"The demon and his conjurers wish to take over the kingdom, what better way to do that than systematically remove the governing body of Leoria? They will still have to face the Regal Guard, but without the king, our power will be lessened. If King Zaden and Knight Jamisson die there is little hope for Leoria, if all the council dies, there is none. Remember this as you vote. Do not do so carelessly and without reason. There are nearly a million lives resting on each vote you cast. Take not this task lightly. You have been warned.\"\n\n\nMore silence.\n\n\n\"You may begin your deliberations, council\"\n\n\nWith that, the Regal Guard filed out the room, and the doors closed ominously behind them, leaving the council, and the usurpers looking 'round the room and each other, wondering who would be the first to  speak."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.331322"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.331322"]]

Basically the Cop role in a normal mafia game. \n\nFluttershy:Elemental Trait:Kindness Townie Role Stare which blocks someones ability. \n\nPinkie Pie:Elemental Trait:Laughter Townie Role 4th Wall Breaking can get a random item. Also since she does this all the time in the show she would be able to pick first when she uses the ability. It will be random the item but she will get to go before anyone else. \n\nTwilight Sparkle:Elemental Trait: Magic Townie Role Investigator. Learn someones role.\n\nRarity:Elemental Trait:Generosity Townie Role For Rarity in this Mafia game the other side namely Discord can really mess with the Main 6 and Rarity is here as a counter to that. Basically Discord can change the Main 6 against their element and pretty much useless to the cause. Rarity can reverse the damage done to her friends if she chooses wisely. After Discord dies Rarity loses the ability. \n\nRainbow Dash:Elemental Trait:Loyalty Townie Role: This is a sacrificial role. Where she can either use her ability once to throw herself on the vote to save someone from death or from blocking a hit on one of her friends. She can only use this once through out the whole game. \n\n\nThe Villains\n\nNightmare Moon: She makes the Day end one hour earlier then usual when she uses her ability. You may ask why I have this ability for her. Basically inactivity can mess with the balance of the game so this evens it for both sides. Mafia gets some trickery to use and townies have to stay on their toes and be attentive. \n\nDiscord.This is the Mafia's big gun. Basically he can turn 1 of the Mane 6 if he chooses correctly against their element. If he happens to get all 6 and he is still alive the game is over. If he dies before then everyone that was discorded will revert back to their previous status. Rarity can revert one of the Mane 6 back if she chooses wisely. \n\nFinally Queen Chrysalis She can be searched twice. On the second search she shows up as who she is. I may change this though \n\n\n\nItems\n\nAnybody can use items. Good or bad.\n\nElements of Harmony\n\nThe Elements of Harmony can be used by someone who finds them but there is a catch. They have to figure out who is the Mane 6 and PM me their guess. They only get one guess a day. If they are correct then they can use it if they wish to use it on 1 person who they think is Mafia. If the Mafia gets the item then they can't use it but they will keep it away from the townies/Mane 6 and if the person with the EoH dies then that becomes unusable to the Mane 6 because it has been corrupted by Darkness. If the person with the EoH dies and is on the townie side then it goes back in the item pile. \n\nInvisible Ink. This is more of a defensive item. You can be invincible for 2 attacks during the night.\n\nPoison Joke Flower. This item causes the holder to not be able to do their action for the day. Be it Role or night action. You have no control over this really till the next day is up. This also affect the Mafias hit if the person in charge of the hit gets it.\n\nUmbrella Hat: Your Pinkie Sense is twitching. Basically you can tell what type of role is being used on you when you have this item but not who is using it on you. Kinda a reverse investigation. You have to figure out who is looking for you yourself.\n\nAnvil:This is one of the attacking items. I am either going to just make it so that it can stun the person for the day. This is different then Poison Joke Flower in that it only affects their role.\n\nBinoculars: This item can tell you the persons role. \n\nKnock out gas: This basically causes the person it is used on to not be able to vote for the next day. \n\nKatana Sword: This item kills one person and then it goes back in the pile. \n \nChocolate Rain: Eternal Chaos comes with Chocolate Rain you guys Chocolate Rain! Basically a lot of bad things happen for both sides. This is an envirmental item and will last for 2 days after it has been unleashed. It basically causes lots of random stuff to happen to the items and roles and the Mafia. Pretty much the vote is the only safe measure unless you are really gambling with things. \n\nMare do Well Mask. This Mask can give the bearer the ability to fly above attacks or defend. The flying has a limited amount of uses. The flying, however will not reset back to the max when it goes back in the pile. The defends have an unlimited amount of uses. Basically you need to vote out this person to get this person out for good whoever is holding it at the time. Can defend against hits by Mafia for townies and can fly over items for the Mafia.\n\nBuzz Saw. This item can kill someone of the players choosing. Simple as that. \n\nFinally the Power of Love Spell. This can be used to either get rid of the Chocolate rain sooner if it is active or to get past Queen Chrystalis blockade of investigations quicker and find out who she is.

So no action will cancel another action.\nDay Actions:  Actions marked as 'Day Action' occur while the thread is open and their effects occur immediately when the Host confirms the action.\n\n Voting:The player with the most votes at the end of the day (adding in any special power affects on those votes) is eliminated from the game and their true role is revealed. In the event of a tie all players involved in the tie will die. Players will type out the players name they wish to vote to kill and bold the name. If they change their mind later, they should go back and unbold and strikethrough the old vote and then post the new vote. Example: (Old Post) Vote Mop it up; (New Post) Vote Khushrenada\nDeath: If you are voted out or killed by a player action you cannot post in any current or new Day Threads and are removed from play in the game. You may not talk about specifics of the game or what you knew until the game is over. You may post general frustration in the Dead Thread which will be created for you to badger and egg on other players or vent your frustrations at your new ethereal state.\n\nFestive Party Crowd (Townie) Roles\nSanta Clause (Benefactor)- This is a new role (as far as I know). Santa and his 'Little Helpers' are seeking to stop the mafia from carrying out their heinous plot while also spreading joy to the world. Santa gets to 'give out' two of the roles on his list each day to different players. Roles to be given out include: Doctor, Vigilante and Investigator. If Santa is killed, his helper then takes over as the next Santa. This new Santa is allowed to select another 'helper' (Role rules for Santa's Little Helper still apply). Gift giving is considered a Day Action. Gifts given after Thread Lock are not issued until the next day and will count towards the new day's gift total. To give a gift, Santa will send a PM to the Host with the name of the player and what gift they shall receive and the Host will notify the player. Santa may give out no more than two different gifts a day. (No multiple doctor toys running around for example). He may give out one or even no gifts if he deems everyone to be on the naughty list.\n\nSanta’s Little Helper (Benefactor’s Apprentice)– Santa chooses a person to be his ‘helper’. This person is not notified by the Host until Santa’s passing that he is the next Santa. The player is free to inform the helper themselves but there is no certainty on the helper's part that this is truth unless the Host is the one telling them this.\n \n \nBoozer (Investigator)- This will be a participation awarded role. The person with the highest number of VALID posts is awarded the power of investigation that night. Multiple posts in a row are not counted. You must wait for someone else to post before you can post again. Post edits do not count. To prevent abuse or attempted abuse someone who repeatedly multiposts and receives three warnings in a day will succumb to alcohol poisoning and pass out. Passed out players will not be able to perform their role or have their vote count for the rest of the day and night. Either a townie or a mafia player can win this role (even if they already have a separate designated role) so this can be a powerful tool for both sides. Repeated offenses in a row may result in a harsher punishment. If it must escalate to this point then the Host will make an announcement in the beginning of a day thread listing out the extended consequences of repeated abuse so there will be no surprise judgments against anyone. \n \nGifted Roles\nAll gifted roles are night actions.\nDoctor Kit (Doctor)- the doctor can select one person to protect throughout the night. This will make them immune to any action that would kill them. Doctor Kit cannot protect someone from being voted \nSuper Solver Seekers Kit (Investigator) - This allows the player to \n.22 (Vigilante) -  The vigilante wants to be a good guy, but taking the law into your own hands can be dangerous. Vigilante can sent in a hit at night to kill a player if they choose to. The catch is that if the target player turns out to be a townie then the vigilante will also die. ***Important- If the role if given to a mafia player, the role changes. The mafia vigilante must hit either Santa or his Helper or else they die as well.\n\n Vengeful Wife and Her Friends (Mafia) Roles\n \n \nVengeful Wife (Godfather) - She is out to get her party-going husband and all of his friends. She puts in the hit every night tokill off one of the party goers. Investigations against her show a regular townie. Getting removed from play leads to The Other Friend becoming the Godfather. If both Godfather and the Goon are killed then the remaining mafia must decide who will be the new godfather. No one after the original Vengeful Wife will be hidden from an investigation. Night Action\n \n Seductress (vote changer)– This is one of the wife’s friends who can choose one player to seduce and change their vote in the final tally. Day Action\n \n The Sharer (role nullifier)– This is one of the wife’s friends who can get another player so drunk that they cannot use their power that night. If they have no power then nothing happens.

I haven't decided times for ending and beginning days.  Being in Korea, I need to think about the best situation, since my days are strange.  The more people sign up the more Monster mayhem I can do.  So please join and lets kick of 2014 giant monster style.\n\nMafia:  The Monsters.  I haven't decided which monsters will be featured, but I do know they will have special abilities.  The special abilities will work like this.  The mafia can choose to either kill someone or use a monsters special ability.  To use the special ability THAT monster with the ability must PM the action to me.  No two special abilities can be performed two days in a row.  However killing is not considered a special ability so the mafia can always kill instead of using a monster's ability, and can kill every day.It is important to communicate as mafia and plan your actions, because if I get a special ability PM, I will do that as the overriding action even if a hit is put in.  (Obviously, if you contact me before the time limit is up, then I can cancel actions and do the actions the mafia desire.)\n\nSpecial Abilities include: \nCounter Attack:  Counter Attacks, prevent the targeted player from using their ability the next day.  It has a delayed result.  So if you use it on Day 1 night action.  The Day 2 action is canceled for the targeted player.  Freeze Attack:  This ability can cancels 2 players votes.  This does not change their vote, but prevents them from voting.  This action does not have a delayed effect, and can be used to change the results of the vote for that day.\nOptic Camouflage:  This ability can hide the identity of all mafia members for the next day.  It has a delayed result.  When Camouflage is activated, It will be posted the monsters are in hiding.  The investigator role will not be able to use their action this turn.  If they do they will get no information back townie or otherwise.   Monsters can still be voted out and killed by Godzilla or a Vigilante if the game has one.  \n\nGodzilla is the killer role. His motivation is to stop the invading monsters, and to protect the fairy twins.  Therefore, Godzilla can win the game if all monsters are killed and the fairy twins are still alive.  If the fairy twins die Godzilla must win by killing everyone…and his anger will give him boosted abilities.  Godzilla acts just like the mafia.  He has special abilities and hits.  Godzilla can choose to kill a player, but if he randomly kills the fairy twins he loses his special ability for the game.  \nSpecial abilities include:  \n1) Energy Absorption.  Godzilla can save energy to do an extra kill the next day.  Energy absorption is a delayed effect.  So night one, Godzilla absorbs energy.  Night 2, he can kill 2 people.  This ability can be stacked multiple times.  \n2) If the twin fairies are killed then Godzilla gains an ability: Revenge.  He gains the ability to perform a second hit the next day, IF he either kills a monster or the player that killed the twin fairies.  If the fairies are killed by the vote there is no bonus against the player whom killed the twins.  This is a delayed ability.  So for example.  The fairies are dead and Godzilla attacks the monsters day 2 and kills one.  Day 3 he has two attacks he can perform.  These can be stacked just like the charge attacks.  However, Godzilla can only get one bonus a day.  So if Day 3 he kills 2 Monsters, he will not get 3 attacks Day 4, but only 2 attacks.  \n\n-Baby Zilla:  If we have enough players.  I will add in this special role. Baby Zilla is a marked townie, that will become Godzilla after Godzilla dies.  Unless Godzilla is the last monster killed, in which a townie victory is declared.  The idea of this role is to give Godzilla the ability to effect the game more.  The original may die.  However, a new player hidden in the townies will rise up.  If Baby Zilla is investigated while in townie mode…he will appear to be a townie.  However, if he takes the role of Godzilla he is investigated as Godzilla.  Baby Zilla does not have any special abilities and therefore will only act as the normal killer role.  \n\nTownie Roles:\n\nFairy Twins:  Townies that know each other.  If we have enough players to make a fair team for the townies, then if one of the fairies die, they both die together.  \n\nScientists:  The Scientists can investigate a player to find their role.  Or they can try to heal a player.  They can heal monster attacks, or can perform a special heal to protect against the vote out, but  lose the ability to do an action the next day.\n\nEDF:  They are the Vigilante.  If they kill a townie or the scientists they will die, but they can kill the mafia, Godzilla, or the fairy twins with no penalty.  Instead of attacking the EDF can Perform a special action and change the vote of a player to a different player.  Those are my basic ideas for abilities.  I think the game should be balanced with a fairly interesting play mechanic devised on teams choosing abilities to use.  Anyway, please sign up if you are interested in playing.\n\nSpecial rule for ties.  I will only kill the characters in a tie.  So remember townies if you want to win you better have decisive votes because there are special powers that can create ties.  Also EDF, you will be a protector for the townies to prevent ties or cause them to trap mafia members.

However, unlike the other 2 times this theme has come up, I've finally played an Animal Crossing game and so now I'm even more enthused about using it. It just works so well.\n\nThe Misadventures of Shangri-La\n\nPrologue\n\n\nI was travelling the rails in search of a new destination after my life fell apart. I hadn't left my house in 9 months because day to day existence had got it's gentle grip on me and was suffocating my soul. When I finally decided to face the world again, I found it had gone to hell. There were weeds everywhere, flies and cochroaches infesting everything and all the cool neighbors and friends I had known had moved, replaced with some weird freaks that I wanted no business with.\n\n \n\n\nFish-Duck here still haunts my mind.\n\nClearly, it was time to make a change in life. Maybe if I started over in a new spot, I'd find the zest for life I used to have when I was friends with all my neighbors and a contributing member of the community. And that is why I hopped on the rails in search of a new destination that sounded right for me. Unfortunately, I was soon accosted by some creepy cat trying to find out all kinds of personal and private information about me. \n\n\nIf one of the first things you have to say to somebody is that you are not crazy, it is because you are. \n \nSince I did mind him sitting with me, I immediately got off at the first stop which was some place called Shangri-La. No sooner do I exit the train station when I'm suddenly confronted by a group of people welcoming me to the town. I checked myself over to make sure I wasn't carrying any drugs in case that was causing all these animals to be attracted to me where ever I went but I was surprisingly clean on that front. Maybe I had already used them because one of the animals from the welcoming committee started telling everyone I was the new mayor and I was taken straight away to City Hall to begin my reign. Now, normally, I might have objected but, as it turns out, my being mayor of the town has always been the host's role in this game so the whole thing kind of works out great storywise.\n\nDespite things seeming to be pretty rosy at first, I soon found out Shangri-La was pretty troubled. First, I found out that the whole real estate market was cornered by one Tom Nook and he was dictating where houses could and couldn't be built and charging whatever he wanted for home sales and renovations. Then when I went shopping, I discovered that a couple of his relatives Timmy and Tommy had basically taken control of the sale of nearly all merchandise for the city and all citizens were at the mercy of whatever they chose to stock and had to buy it at whatever price they chose to sell. \n\nI wasn't going to stand for an iron grip on the marketplace so I went to find the local sheriff to see about busting up this cartel. That's when I discovered there was no police station in town. Apparently, it's something that has to be requested by the citizens and then money has to be raised to build it and hire a detective. Thus, I gathered the citizens and explained the situation to them. It wasn't easy. They wanted me to pick fruit for them and deliver packages for them and fish for them but I finally was able to win them over and agree to get a police station started. \n\nIt felt so good. Once again, I had a purpose in life beyond just picking weeds and buying a new piece of clothing. I was going to help these people to cast off the oppresive economic sanctions being levelled against them by the corrupt Nook empire and lead them to a better life of freedom with plenty of bells for all. Of course, things can look great in theory but when applied to the real world, well, then you can encounter some bumps along the way as I was about to discover........"], ["complete", "t"], ["mafia_won", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.344710"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.344710"]]

I may just do nothing, I may kill everyone who voted for a tie, I may pick some people and apply the 'voteless' or 'suicidal' role to them, it's like landing on a bowser space in mario party, except no sympathy for fourth place. \n\nbut the fun doesn't stop there, I may stop noting if for example a mafia member is killed to increase the suspense or start lying to the investigative roles, I may  kill anyone that Rachel tries to save.

With the help of the Doctor, a time traveler who showed up on the same day, they were able to learn that George Ratcliffe was working with a race of creatures known as the Daleks. It appears that there are not one, but two opposing Dalek factions who both seek control of a device known as the Hand of Omega which the Doctor claims to have stashed somewhere in town a while back. However The Doctor believes that the ICMG has been infiltrated by both Dalek factions.\n\n\nGroup Captain Gilmore (cop): leader of the ICMG (Intrusion Countermeasures Group) he can use his sources in the British intelligence agency to investigate other players and find out their roles. Group Captain Gilmore has two day 1 investigations, use them wisely captain.\n\n\nThe Doctor (Role blocker): Is aware of everything that happens at night and can prevent any night actions from happening. This ability can only be used Twice. He also has the ability to, at any time regenerate.\n\nRegeneration Should the Doctor opt to regenerate he will lose any of his additional night actions and his ability to vote but will still be able to guide the townies from beyond the grave. If it is done during the day then any votes made against him will be canceled.\n\n\nDr. Rachel Jensen: (Doctor) Captain Gilmore's scientific advisor and medical personnel. Has the ability to protect someone but not herself.\n\n\nDorothy \"Ace\" Mcshane: (Vigilante): instead of cowering in fear and screaming like his previous companions the Doctors current companion goes after daleks with baseball bats and her own specialized homemade explosive compound.\n\n\nMike Smith (Miller): a young man formerly employed to George Ratcliffe. Although he is functionally a normal townie should he be investigated Captain Gilmore will be told he is a Dalek. The Dalek investigators will merely be told that he's a townie.\n\nimportant, the player given the Mike Smith role will not be aware of his role. Thus anyone given the role 'townie' could potentially be Mike Smith\n\nThe Mafias:\nImperial Daleks:\n\nDavros (godfather): leader of the Imperial Daleks, registers as townie when investigated. \n\n\nSpecial Weapons Dalek(role cop): A special forces Dalek who's advanced targeting systems can be used to investigate a player and learn of their roles. This ability can be used twice for a night action on day 1 with a third additional use under the wing for future use. Dalek supreme, and Captain Gilmore are unaffected.\n\nImperial Dalek drone:\n\nIt's a regular dalek, what else is there to say. It shoots lasers and serves Davros. (Will be put into play when we reach 12 players along with its renegade counterpart)\n\nRenegade Daleks\n\nDalek Supreme(godfather 2): Leader of the renegade Daleks. Registers as townie when investigated.\n\n\nLittle girl/battle computer(role cop): The Dalek Battle computer leeches off the mind of a little girl and her capacity for imagination. Because of this the little girl can be controlled by the computer by remote and used to investigate for player roles with the exception of Davros and Captain Gilmore. This ability can be used twice for a night action on day 1 with a third additional use under the wing.\n\n\nRenegade Dalek drone: I think of the two, this is the one you shake to get pepper. Oh nope, it's shooting lasers at me. \n\nTie rule: God so help you if there's a tie. I may just do nothing, I may kill everyone who voted for a tie, I may pick some people and apply the 'voteless' or 'suicidal' role to them, it's like landing on a bowser space in mario party, except no sympathy for fourth place.\n\nLast time as you may recall I basically killed off an entire Dalek faction. I plan to be a bit more careful about how that sort of thing pans out this time if I decide to go that route.\n\nAnother idea I have is to send a few PMs kindly informing those who recieve them that I'm going to kill them in a day or two. I think it's a really Osgood way to kill someone off, wouldn't you agree? But don't tell anyone... we'll call it, \"our secret girl thing.\"\n\nOf course I could always do a few public investigations and let you respond accordingly, maybe lie about the results for one of them, It's a bit psychological really.\n\nOr I may just do nothing, as in not even having the two people who the town decided to vote against killed. That's always fun. Especially if I make it so neither of those people \n\nBecause there is no killer starting on day 4 both dalek factions will be able to make a hit. Day 2 will only allow the renegade Daleks to make a hit while Day 3 will only allow the imperial Daleks to make a hit. Neither faction will be given a kill on the first day which could be interesting.\n\nSilenced Godfather Clause: if the godfather cannot preform his duties for whatever reason one of his underlings may request a night kill in his place. However if both the godfather and his underling request a kill then the Godfather's kill request will be granted. On day one the two investigations by the Little Girl and Special Weapons Dalek can also be redeemed by this method.\nNight actions for all roles are due 20 minutes after the Days end. The Doctor will then be sent a list of night actions and asked if he wishes to block any of them (again this can be done twice), if you have a night action just PM me telling me who you want to investigate/kill/save."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.351854"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.351854"]]

Some are reasonably sized and could be climbed with ease. Others are gigantic cliffs that spell certain death to anyone daring enough to scale them.\n\nInside of these mountains, within an intricate network of caves, a colony of miners reside. They harvest grafituum—a metallic-like substance that can be melted to make energy—from the depths of the frozen landscape. The life of many a citizen runs on grafituum products. This particular miner group, Apex Mining, is the leading manufacturer.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarown has recently fallen on terrible times, and an economic downturn is slaughtering the labor force. Unemployment is increasing rapidly, and wages aren’t substantial to help life, partly due to an alarming inflation rise. To avoid the crisis, many companies have been looking to the mountains to try and weasel their way into the grafituum business, hoping to give jobs to workers and save the dwindling economy.\n\nApex, however, isn’t hearing a word of it. After hundreds of years in the trade, they have monopolized the occupation, and they refuse to lose their grip on it, fearful of becoming victimized by new competition.\n\nThe government of Sarown is too weak to make a decisive response. The outcries of multiple corporations at the unfair tactics of Apex fail to be taken into proper account. It seems as though there is no other option but to take matters into one’s own hands.\n\nFairman Products, a manufacturer of oil, which years ago was outclassed by grafituum, holds a particularly strong grudge against Apex. Wanting to reclaim their spot as top dogs in the energy industry, they begin to devise plans to sabotage Apex mines and to force the company to evacuate. Using stealth technology and key information of the company’s mines, Fairman employees begin to enter workplaces, setting up bombs or ruining electrical equipment and causing breakdowns.\n\nTheodore Apex, the stubborn president of his self-titled grafituum enterprise, sees these “failures” for what they are: attempted disruption attempts against the syndicate. Not willing to back down from a fight, Theodore vows that Apex will continue to control the business, beating out all that are brave enough to wander into the fray.\n\nA quiet war quickly begins. Fairman shoots first, sending in a clan of mercenaries in order to knock a particular Apex mine out-of-business. It’s a violent struggle between two heavyweights—one reluctant to relinquish his title, the other wanting his back.\n\nLet the games begin!!!\nGeneral Info:\nThis game will have a closed setup: the roles will be UNKNOWN except to the people that have them.\nBeing a closed setup game, this is not necessarily for the new players, but the game will be open to players of all skill levels.\nIt may be fun, but it IS serious: sign-up if you know you’ll be an active player.\nHave fun, most important part!.\nAbout voting:\nTo vote, use the format of vote username. Yes, it must be bolded. Preferably, put this at the end of your post.\n\nWhenever you want to No-Lynch, Abstain, or Unvote, the same formula goes.\n\nFor a vote to go through, a majority of the players must have voted on the same subject. When this occurs, everyone stops talking while the host wraps up the day events and prepares for the night portion of the game.\n\nRoles:\n\nTo use a role: To use any role given in this game, the only way to use your ability is to PM the host. So if your ability gives you the power to kill someone at night, you have to PM the host saying who you want to kill during nighttime hours. For day abilities, send a PM during day hours saying what you shall do with your ability.\n\nTown (x8 players, 3 power roles):\nCop - investigates a person each night\nDoctor - protects a person each night\nManager - has double vote power for two days (activated by sending a PM to the host)\nWorker - normal townie role\n\nMafia (x3 players, 2 power roles):Godfather - sends in hit, immune to investigation\nBodyguard - can protect the Godfather one night (activated by sending a PM to the host), takes over hit duties if Godfather dies and loses his ability\nInsurgent - normal mafia role, takes over hit duties if Godfather and Bodyguard are dead\n\nThird Party (x1 player, 1 power role):Timebomb - can set a bomb during the night (can only do this twice); he/she PMs the host with a target and a number ranging from 1 to 10 (this being the number of times the bomb can be passed), and during the day the target will be alerted they have the bomb and they must pass it on; when the amount of passes specified in the PM has been reached, the latest recipient of the bomb will die\n\n\nWin Conditions:\n\nWin Conditions will be stated in the role PMs given out before the game begins.\nThe roles present will be determined by how many people sign up. If not many people sign up the game will stay closed, but with fewer roles."], ["complete", "t"], ["created_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.353728"], ["updated_at", "2016-09-01 16:31:04.353728"]]

Khushrenada has a history of being able to revitalize areas of stagnation with new growth and ideas as well as fighting for animal rights by continually trying to innovate and experiment against the status quo. However, despite these positives, Khushrenada has his critics with some saying he has ties to a criminal animal underworld and is being supported by the Shere Khan mafia to ensure their interests and stranglehold on the Animal Kingdom. Khushrenada's political rival Insanolord has already stated that electing Khushrenada would bring about the end of the Animal Kingdom and the ruination of everything all animals have been building up and working on for 15 years. Asked about this, Khushrenada just laughed and said, \"Animals have been accusing me of these things for years with no evidence to support their claims yet to appear. Facts are that I've done more to build the Animal Kingdom than most and the history of this land backs me up on this. I have no ties to the Shere Khan Mafia and do not know where this spurious slander has come from.\"\n\n\nExcerpt from The Insect Inquisitor:\n\nHas Man Entered the Animal Kingdom Again?\n\nOblivion the Ox was found dead in the Serengeti Swamp. Bystanders say they heard a loud bang before Oblivion's collapse with others saying they saw a shadowy two-legged creature move quickly from some nearby bushes and climb onto a strange wheeled beast that took off at high speed. Police Chief Rin Tin Tin has said that he is still investigating the matter and doesn't want to jump to any conclusion too soon. He asks that the public not become panicked or spooked too hastily because of rumours. Unfortunately, a lemming colony has already run over a cliff in fear from the news and died in what other lemmings are calling a typical Tuesday. Despite calls for calmness from the police, many animals are arming themselves in an effort to provide a measure of security for their wellbeing. With the Animal Kingdom election already causing much divide throughout the land, officials worry that this current climate of fear could lead to a bloodshed if the citizenry are not careful.\n\n\nCitizenry Arming Themselves:\n\nYou've heard the legends.
